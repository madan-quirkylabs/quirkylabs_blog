Imagine your brain is like a super excited puppy, always running around, sometimes knocking things over by accident. You're at a friend's house, and oops! The puppy's tail swings too fast, tipping over a flower vase. Splash! Water everywhere!

You start saying "sorry" like it's your favorite song on repeat. Sorry for the mess, sorry for the noise, sorry for just being... you.

But then, your friend hands you a towel with a smile, not a frown. "It's just water," they chuckle. "Let's clean it up together!"

What if you could see your missteps as just a bit of spilled water? Simple to mop up, easy to laugh off. Next time you trip up, remember, it's okay to be a bit messy. Want to join the clean-up crew with a smile?

Once upon a bustling afternoon, Sammy, a young squirrel with sparkly eyes and a bouncy tail, was preparing for the big Nut Festival in Squirreltown. Sammy had ADHD, which meant his mind was like a pinball machine—ideas popped and zipped everywhere! This often led to a quirky trait known as ADHD over apologizing. Every leaf he brushed past, he'd chirp a swift, "Sorry!" Every acorn he nudged, another, "Oops, my bad!"

Sammy's friends knew this dance well. They chuckled lovingly as he made his whirlwind apologies through the forest, collecting decorations.

### Oops! Sorry about That!

At the stream, Sammy accidentally splashed water on Bella Bee. "Oh dear! Sorry, Bella!" he squeaked. Bella smiled and buzzed, "No worries, Sammy!"

Making his way back, he bumped into Gary Grasshopper. "Ah! Sorry, Gary!" Sammy exclaimed, his voice a mix of surprise and habit.

Gary just laughed and leaped away. "You're fine, Sammy! See you at the festival!"

Sammy's heart was warm but his head was a swirl of thoughts. "Maybe I say sorry too much," he pondered, tail flicking with each thought.

When we last left our hero, Captain Focus, she was navigating the bustling city of Brainopolis, where thoughts zoom like cars and ideas flicker like neon lights. Her superpower? The incredible speed of her mind, thanks to her trusty sidekick, ADHD.

However, this superpower sometimes made her bump into the pesky habit of over-apologizing. Every time Captain Focus zigzagged through conversations or missions, she'd toss out "sorrys" like confetti at a parade. It wasn't that she was always doing something wrong; her brain just liked to make sure all bases were covered, even ones that didn't really need it.

Feeling perpetually on the brink of being too much for others, she often wondered if her intense energy was a challenge for those around her to handle. [Adhd Too Much For Others](/pages/adhd-too-much-for-others/)

### A Detour through Sorryville

One day, Captain Focus met a wise old owl named Professor Hoot, who noticed her over-apologizing. "My dear Captain," he said, perched on a glimmering lamppost, "you sprinkle 'sorry' like salt on popcorn. But not every kernel needs it!"

Captain Focus thought about that. Maybe she didn't need to apologize for her mind's racecar speed. Perhaps she could save her "sorrys" for when she truly needed them, like accidentally using her super-speed to knock over the mailboxes of conversation.

From then on, Captain Focus tried to keep her "sorrys" in her superhero belt, only pulling them out when absolutely necessary. It wasn't easy, but with Professor Hoot's wise words echoing in her mind, she began to feel a bit lighter, like a backpack loosened after a long day.

By managing her apologies, Captain Focus found she could navigate Brainopolis better, making her an even more effective superhero. And the citizens? They didn't need an apology for her super-speed; they celebrated it, cheering her on as she zoomed, a blur of brilliance and determination.

In the cozy world of Willow Grove, Benny the squirrel had learned a lot about his tendency for ADHD over-apologizing. He realized that his apologies were like leaves tumbling endlessly in the fall wind—beautiful but a bit overwhelming when in piles.

Benny decided to try something new: replacing some sorrys with thank yous. Instead of "Sorry for babbling," he'd chirp, "Thank you for listening!"

In his journey, Benny also confronted his deep-seated [ADHD fear of rejection](/pages/adhd-fear-of-rejection/), realizing that his over-apologizing was partly a shield against being dismissed or disliked.

### Leafy Lessons in Gratitude

His friends noticed the change. They felt sunnier, like a morning without clouds. Benny felt lighter too, like a leaf finally resting on the ground after a playful dance in the breeze.

"Thank you for being patient," Benny smiled more often now. His friends nodded, their hearts warm as toasted acorns.

Benny learned that every sorry didn't need an echo. Sometimes, one heartfelt thank you was enough to show his golden intentions.

So, remember, like Benny, every one of us can turn our sorry leaves into gratitude trees. And who knows? Maybe our friendships will grow stronger, rooted in understanding and kindness.
