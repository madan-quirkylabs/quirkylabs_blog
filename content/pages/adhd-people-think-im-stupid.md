In a bustling kitchen, Sam's thoughts buzzed like a blender left on high. Ideas whirled and splashed out in colorful bursts, missing the bowl sometimes.

Around him, people chatted in a smooth, slow drip like a coffee maker. But Sam's words popped like popcorn, surprising and sudden.

"Slow down," they'd chuckle, sifting through his popped kernels for the fluffy ones. "What's the rush?"

Sam felt like his brain was a pinball machine, lights flashing, bells ringing. To others, it seemed a noisy jumble. But each bright light was a brilliant idea, each sound a spark of creativity.

Join us on a dive into the whirling, sparkling world of ADHD minds. Ready to see the brilliance in the buzz?

Once upon a time in the bustling town of Brainwave, there lived a young girl named Ellie. Her mind was like a super-charged pinball machine. Thoughts zipped and bounced everywhere, all at once. Ellie had ADHD, and because of her zig-zaggy focus, some folks misunderstood her brilliant mind.

At school, Ellie often heard whispers, "ADHD people think I'm stupid." It stung a little each time, but she knew better than to believe it. Her brain just ran on sparkly, high-octane fuel, making ordinary thoughts extraordinary!

## ADHD Misunderstood Intelligence: Why People Judge & Why They‚Äôre Wrong

One sunny Thursday, Mrs. Maple, the science teacher, announced a project about the solar system. Ellie's hand shot up like a rocket. "Can I make a model with rotating planets?"

Mrs. Maple smiled. "What a wonderful idea, Ellie!"

Ellie's classmates looked puzzled. How could her jumpy thoughts hatch such a cool plan? But Ellie's mind was a playground of ideas, always ready to swing into action.

So, there we were, me and my buddy Ziggy, the zigzagging squirrel, in the middle of a chat. Ziggy had just bounced up to me, cheeks stuffed with acorns, eyes wide with worry. "I heard some folks saying, 'ADHD people think I'm stupid'," he chattered. "But that's just nuts, right?"

I chuckled, shaking my head. "Oh, Ziggy, it‚Äôs like when you try to store your acorns all in one tree and forget the other trees where you hid them. People sometimes forget to see the whole forest.‚Äù

Feeling misunderstood or underestimated due to ADHD can often lead to a [sense of low self-worth](/pages/adhd-low-self-worth/), but remember, Ziggy, every mind has its unique way of shining.

## ADHD Thinking Patterns: Embrace the Zigzag Genius Inside You

Just like Ziggy‚Äôs forest, filled with hidden acorn treasures, every ADHD brain is bustling with thoughts. Sometimes, these thoughts scatter like leaves in the wind, making it hard for us to catch them all. But that doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs less value in the forest; it‚Äôs just a bit more colorful and unpredictable.

Ziggy nodded, his tiny paw tapping his head. ‚ÄúSo, it‚Äôs not about being less, but being different?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly!‚Äù I exclaimed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about embracing the whirlwind inside and using it to explore new ideas. Just like you explore the forest!‚Äù

Ziggy grinned, finally understanding. He scampered off to spread the word, leaving a trail of acorn wisdom in his wake.

In the cozy warmth of the caf√©, Sam's story took a turn. "You know, some folks think ADHD means you're not smart. They think, 'ADHD people think I'm stupid.' But that's not true at all!"

Lou chuckled, sipping his hot chocolate. "That's like saying a cheetah can't run because it's napping!"

Lou's understanding gaze deepened as he added, "And you know, carrying those old labels from childhood isn't fair to anyone," referencing the deep-seated impact of [ADHD Childhood Labels](/pages/adhd-childhood-labels/).

Sam nodded, his eyes twinkling. "Exactly! Sometimes, our brains just race on a different track!"

## ADHD and Self-Worth: How to Ditch Doubt and Celebrate Your Brain

They spent the afternoon sharing stories, each more colorful than the last. Sam felt lighter, like a leaf dancing in the wind.

Lou smiled warmly. "It's not about being fast or slow, smart or not. It‚Äôs about being you."

Sam left the caf√© with a new bounce in his step. He realized that what makes us different makes us special. And that's pretty smart, isn't it?

### Practical FAQs

<details><summary>Why do some adhd people think I'm stupid when I struggle to keep up in conversations?</summary><p>Oh, feeling like you're not keeping up in conversations can definitely be frustrating, but remember, it's really not about intelligence at all! Many folks with ADHD might process information or manage their focus in ways that aren't always in sync with traditional conversational flow. This might make it seem like they're not following along, but it's just a difference in how their brain handles multiple stimuli or shifts attention. It‚Äôs important to remind yourself of your unique strengths and understand that everyone has their own unique pace and style in communication.</p></details>
<details><summary>How can I communicate better when adhd people think I'm stupid due to my slow response times?</summary><p>It's really wonderful that you're taking steps to communicate more effectively ‚Äî that shows a lot of self-awareness and consideration!

This can open up a dialogue that helps both sides understand each other better, fostering a more inclusive and supportive interaction.</p></details>
<details><summary>Can the perception that adhd people think I'm stupid affect my self-esteem?</summary><p>Absolutely, the way others perceive and react to us can definitely impact our self-esteem, especially when it comes to something as personal as ADHD. It's important to remember, though, that ADHD involves challenges with attention and may affect how you communicate your thoughts, not your intelligence. Also, everyone, ADHD or not, has unique strengths and areas for growth. It might help to surround yourself with supportive people who understand the nuances of ADHD and remind yourself of your own capabilities and achievements.</p></details>
<details><summary>What strategies can help when adhd people think I'm stupid and dismiss my ideas?</summary><p>It can feel really disheartening when you feel dismissed or misunderstood, especially in conversations where you‚Äôre sharing your ideas.

Remember, your thoughts and contributions are valuable, and seeking clarity in communication can often bridge the gap between misunderstandings.</p></details>



### Curious ADHD Questions

<details><summary>Why do I feel like adhd people think I'm stupid when we're discussing new ideas?</summary><p>It's totally understandable to feel this way, but remember, ADHD minds often run at a high speed and can jump quickly from one idea to another. This doesn't at all reflect on your intelligence or the value of your contributions. It might be helpful to remind yourself that this fast-paced thinking style is just a characteristic of how some brains are wired. Perhaps consider gently reminding your friends that you need a bit more time to process information, which will help bridge the communication style and make discussions more inclusive and enjoyable for everyone.</p></details>
<details><summary>How can I communicate better if I think adhd people think I'm stupid?</summary><p>It‚Äôs really common to feel unsure about communication, especially when you‚Äôre worried about how others perceive you. Remember, the key to good communication is clarity and openness. When talking with someone who has ADHD, try being clear and direct about your thoughts and feelings. Also, consider asking them how they prefer to communicate. Everyone is different, and finding out their communication style can help you both feel more comfortable and understood. Don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself‚Äîyou‚Äôre doing great by seeking to improve and adapt!</p></details>
<details><summary><p>Feeling underestimated can be disheartening, but it's important to address this concern openly and gently.

<details><summary>What should I do when adhd people think I'm stupid because I process things differently?</summary><p>It's really tough to feel misunderstood, especially by those who might be experiencing their own unique challenges with processing. Remember, ADHD can affect how people communicate and perceive others, so their reactions may not be a true reflection of your capabilities or worth. A cozy chat where you share your feelings and learn about each other's experiences can help bridge understanding. Always know that your way of processing is just as valid and valuable as any other‚Äîit's what makes you uniquely you!</p></details>
<details><summary>Is it common for adhd people to think I'm stupid, or am I just being sensitive?</summary><p>Oh, it's really common to feel that way, but let me reassure you, you're definitely not alone in this, and it doesn't mean you're stupid at all. Many people with ADHD struggle with feelings of inadequacy or being misunderstood because of how ADHD can affect their communication and task management.
