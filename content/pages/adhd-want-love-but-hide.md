Imagine your heart is like a bouncy castle, full of colorful thoughts.

Sometimes it feels too squishy and crowded, making it hard to let anyone inside.

You peek out from behind the castle walls, wanting to play, but also wanting to hide.

It's like playing hide-and-seek with your feelings, isn't it? Peek-a-boo, here's my heart!

Let's find a cozy corner, where it's okay to be both bouncy and a bit hidden. 

Ready to play?

In the cozy corner of a bustling café, Jamie twitched like a squirrel in a dance-off. Their eyes darted from the steam swirling from their coffee to the colorful flyers on the wall. Jamie's mind was a pinball machine, thoughts bouncing wildly from one shiny bumper to another. 

"Just focus," Jamie muttered, trying to pin down one thought about what they really wanted. 

### Love in a Game of Hide and Seek

Deep down, Jamie knew. ADHD want love but hide, like a mischievous cat playing behind curtains. They craved connections that felt as warm as the sunlit spot on the café’s window seat. But admitting it? That was the heart-racing, stomach-twisting challenge.

Jamie’s thoughts raced like a hummingbird at a flower festival. They wanted to share their whirlwind world with someone. But how to slow down long enough to explain the chaos? How to show their true colors without the swirls getting in the way?

So, they smiled, sipped their coffee, and let their gaze wander once more.

When we last left our hero, Zippy the squirrel, he was darting about the forest, stuffing his cheeks with acorns. Just like Zippy, sometimes people with ADHD want love but hide from it, fearing they might be too much for others.

Zippy was a whirlwind of energy, always zigzagging from one tree to another. His friends loved his zest but sometimes found it hard to keep up. Zippy worried his endless hustle might push them away, so he often scampered up the tallest oak, watching from a distance, wishing he could just be still.

Feeling his anxieties bubble, he confessed another deep fear, often wondering if his friends might eventually decide he was [too emotional](/pages/adhd-too-emotional/) to handle.

### A Nutty Idea

One sunny afternoon, Dotty the wise old owl noticed Zippy on his lonesome branch. "Why so solitary, my speedy friend?" she hooted.

Zippy shrugged, sending a shower of leaves fluttering down like confetti. "I don’t want to be too much for anyone," he admitted with a sigh, his tiny heart thumping like a drummer in a parade.

Dotty fluttered down beside him, her eyes soft and understanding. "Zippy, did you know that sometimes, sharing your swirls and twirls can help others find their own rhythm?"

Zippy’s ears perked up. He hadn’t thought of it that way. Maybe he didn’t have to hide his whirlwind nature; perhaps it was just about finding the right pace together.

As the night drew to a close, everyone gathered to share stories and laughter. Jamie, feeling a bit braver, decided it was time to let their friends in a little more. "You know, sometimes my ADHD makes me want love but hide instead," Jamie confessed, their voice a mix of nerves and relief.

The friends listened, their faces warm and understanding. They shared hugs with Jamie, making the night feel a little less chilly. It was like Jamie's heart had been wrapped in a cozy blanket.

Often, Jamie worried their ADHD made them [too emotional](/pages/adhd-too-emotional/), but this night showed how emotions could also build bridges.

### Cozy Hearts Club

The next day, Jamie felt lighter, as if they had set down a heavy backpack filled with rocks. Their friends checked in, sending funny memes and sweet messages. It was clear that sharing their truth had not pushed people away but pulled them closer.

In the end, Jamie learned a valuable lesson. Hiding was less about protecting themselves and more about missing out on the warmth of others. They didn't need to hide to be loved; they just needed to be themselves.

From then on, Jamie decided to be open, one small step at a time. After all, every heart deserves to feel the warmth of love, no hiding required.
