Imagine your brain is like a hyper puppy, excited by every new toy. You start building a Lego castle, but oh look—there's a bouncy ball!

Suddenly, the puppy dashes off, leaving the castle half-built. You chase the puppy, but by the time you catch up, you're too pooped to play anymore.

Feeling like your projects are a bunch of half-built castles? Let's find a way to help that puppy play to the end!

Once upon a sunny afternoon, Jamie found herself staring at a jigsaw puzzle. A thousand pieces lay scattered like stars in the sky, each one begging to fit somewhere. Jamie loved starting puzzles. But finishing them? That was a whole other universe.

She felt a burst of excitement, her mind like a pinball machine. Lights flashing! Ideas bouncing! But halfway through, her energy fizzled out like a forgotten cupcake left out in the rain. This wasn't just tiredness; it was like her brain had run a marathon in flip-flops.

### A Puzzle Too Puzzling?

Jamie called this feeling "ADHD followthrough fatigue." It's when your brain says, "Let’s go!" but then spots a squirrel and forgets about the marathon. It happens a lot when you have ADHD. You start with a rocket boost, then suddenly you're out of fuel on the moon.

She looked at her half-done puzzle. Should she push through or take a break? Her cat, Whiskers, sauntered over, plopped down on the puzzle box, and yawned. Maybe a little nap was okay. Whiskers seemed to think so.

When we last left our hero, the Energizer Bunny of Taskland, he was feeling the prickly paws of ADHD followthrough fatigue. Imagine him as a knight, bravely battling a dragon, but the dragon keeps growing new heads every time he thinks he's about to win!

One minute, our bunny is hopping with purpose, ready to save the day. The next, he's sprawled in the meadow, wondering why his armor feels so heavy. It's like trying to juggle jellybeans on a windy day—things just keep slipping away!

Amidst all this, he can't help but feel the weight of his [ADHD big dreams no follow through](/pages/adhd-big-dreams-no-follow-through/), as grand visions of elaborate castles in the sky seem just out of reach, yet so vivid in his imagination.

### Bunny's Battle with the Blanket of Fatigue

Now, imagine this fatigue as a big, comfy blanket. It sounds nice, right? But not when you're trying to be a knight. Our bunny tries to throw off the blanket, but it's cozy and persuasive, whispering, "Stay a bit longer."

With every task he starts, there’s a sneaky tug at his foot pulling him back to rest. It's not that he doesn’t want to fight the dragon or finish building his castle; it’s just so easy to sink into the soft grass and watch the clouds.

So, how does our bunny hero keep his hop? He learns to take small leaps. One paw in front of the other, slow and steady. Sometimes, he even finds a fellow knight or a wise owl to remind him of his quests.

After a whirlwind of excitement and energy, Sam was feeling the weight of ADHD followthrough fatigue. The once sparkling ideas seemed to dim under the shadow of exhaustion. Yet, Sam wasn't ready to give up just yet. With a deep breath, they reminded themselves that every cloud has a silver lining—even if it's a bit frayed.

### A Spoonful of Perseverance!

In those moments, the fear of unfulfilled potential crept in, but Sam knew that overcoming the [ADHD Fear of Failure](/pages/adhd-fear-of-failure/) was just another hill to climb.

Sam decided to tackle the tasks bit by bit. They broke down the mountain into manageable hills. First, finish the book report. Next, clean the turtle's tank. Each small victory brought a smile and a sprinkle of confidence.

Sam's friends noticed the change. "You're doing it, Sam!" they cheered, tossing high fives like confetti. Their support was the perfect wind beneath Sam's wings.

In the cozy embrace of the clubhouse, surrounded by friends and finished tasks, Sam felt a warm glow. The journey was bumpy, but oh, so worth it. "One step at a time," Sam whispered, a secret recipe for success.

So, whenever you feel overwhelmed, remember Sam and their spoonful of perseverance. Tackle one task, then the next. And always, always keep your friends close. They're your cheerleaders on the sidelines of this playful game called life.

### Curious ADHD Questions

<details><summary>Why does 'ADHD followthrough fatigue' make me feel like I'm wearing lead boots?</summary><p>That feeling of wearing lead boots when you're struggling with ADHD follow-through fatigue is incredibly common and completely understandable.
