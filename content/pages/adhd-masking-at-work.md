Imagine juggling squishy tomatoes at a work meeting. Slippery, right?

You catch them, toss them, and smile like it's a fun circus act.

But oh, those tomatoes are your thoughts, slipping and sliding everywhere!

You wear a sparkly magician’s hat, waving away distractions. Poof! Now you see focus, now you don't!

Everyone claps, but your arms are tired. You just want to put the tomatoes down.

But guess what? It's okay to rest those circus arms. Want to learn how together?

In the bustling beehive of BeeBop's office, everything buzzed with a sort of organized chaos. BeeBop, a bright-eyed, bushy-tailed employee with ADHD, was a wizard at juggling tasks. But there was a secret trick up his sleeve: ADHD masking at work.

Each morning, BeeBop strapped on his superhero cape, which was invisible, of course. It helped him blend into the buzzing office without anyone noticing his ADHD superpowers—like hyperfocus and creative whirlwinds.

### BeeBop's Hidden Cape

This cape wasn't just any cape. It was woven from threads of "just fitting in" and "keeping the quirks under wraps." While BeeBop could brainstorm like a boss and hop between tasks faster than anyone, he often tucked these talents away.

So, there we were back at the office, where our hero, the chameleon, was busy blending in. Remember, blending is just a fancy way for saying "ADHD masking at work." This chameleon was a pro at changing colors to match the office decor—be it the grey of the cubicles or the stark white of the conference room walls.

Now, ADHD masking is a bit like wearing a heavy costume all day. It can be exhausting! Imagine wearing a superhero cape that's a tad too tight, or boots that don't quite fit right. 

Despite the initial fear, our chameleon friend started to wonder if he was just [performing productivity](/pages/adhd-performative-productivity/) rather than genuinely thriving, sparking a journey towards embracing his true self at work.

### A Colorful Dilemma

One day, our chameleon friend decided to try something new. Instead of blending in, he wore a bright, polka-dotted tie. Just a small splash of color, but oh, it felt rebellious!

His coworkers noticed. They smiled, and one even chuckled, "Love the tie, Cam!" That tiny change sparked a big difference. The chameleon felt a little less tired that day, a bit more like himself.

From that day, he started adding more of his true colors to his office attire. It was scary at first, sure. But each splash of color made his heavy costume feel a little lighter. And that made all the difference.

As the days passed, Jamie found that the effort of ADHD masking at work was like juggling water balloons—slippery and bound to burst eventually. But, with each shared chuckle and understanding nod from colleagues, Jamie's fear of dropping the balloons lessened.

### Unmasking the Magic

In these moments, Jamie also started to tackle the gnawing [ADHD impostor syndrome](/pages/adhd-impostor-syndrome/), realizing they weren't alone in their feelings of self-doubt.

One sunny afternoon, Jamie decided it was time to let some balloons pop. Sitting down with their team, Jamie shared openly about their ADHD. It was like opening a window in a stuffy room; fresh understanding breezed in.

To Jamie's surprise, not only did the team not mind, but they also offered support and strategies to make daily tasks less of a circus act. The office even started a weekly check-in, turning into a garden where everyone could grow their own way.

From then on, Jamie felt lighter, like a leaf dancing on the wind. Work became a place not just of tasks, but of teamwork and true colors shining through.

So, remember, it's okay to let some balloons pop. Each burst might just let in a gust of fresh, wonderful wind!

## Quickfire ADHD Checklist

1. **Juggle those thoughts like a clown at a circus!** Keep your ideas flying high but easy to catch.

2. **Wear your 'Game Face' mask.** Sometimes, at work, it's like being at a superhero masquerade!

3. **Spin that playlist!** Let music be your invisible cape, smoothing out the rough edges.

4. **Find your cozy corner.** Like a cat in a sunbeam, find that spot where you can shine without shadows.
