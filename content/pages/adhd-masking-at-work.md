Jenny's workday felt like juggling jellybeans while riding a unicycle. Colorful but tricky!

Every email was a sneaky jellybean, slipping through her fingers, demanding to be caught.

 

In meetings, she wore her "Super Focused" mask, even though her brain danced to a silent disco. Shh, don't tell!

Outside, she nodded. Inside, her thoughts were busy bouncing like ping-pong balls in a lottery machine.

 

But guess what? Every day, she got a bit better at catching those jellybeans. 

And you? Ready to share your secret superpowers?

In the bustling beehive of an office, where papers buzzed from desk to desk, lived Benny the Bee. Benny was not your regular worker bee; he had a sparkly twist—ADHD. But at work, Benny often wore a mask, not the kind for costume parties, but an invisible one. He buzzed from one task to another, trying to look just like every other bee.

### A Buzzing Ballet of Busy Bees

Benny’s mask was his secret superpower. It helped him juggle files and answer calls without missing a beat. To the other bees, Benny seemed like he was dancing gracefully through his chores.

But oh, the energy it took! Benny felt like he was juggling watermelons instead of small, light pollen balls. Keeping up the dance while hiding his true buzzing style was tiring.

Can Benny keep up this masked ballet? Or will he find a way to buzz in his own unique way? Stay tuned!

In the bustling beehive of work, everyone hummed their own tune. But for Alex, the tune was a bit more complicated. Alex had ADHD and often engaged in 'ADHD masking at work.' This meant Alex tried very hard to play the same melody as everyone else, even if it didn’t come naturally.

### Hide and Seek with Myself

Amidst this exhausting charade, a colleague's genuine compliment slid into Alex's day, triggering an unexpected wave of [ADHD Compliment Doubt](/pages/adhd-compliment-doubt/), as Alex wondered if the praise was truly deserved or just another part of the elaborate mask.

Imagine Alex as a chameleon, changing colors not to stand out but to blend in. During meetings, Alex would nod like a bobblehead, even if the mind zipped to a faraway land of forgotten tasks and creative ideas.

Lunchtime was a stealth mission. Alex would mimic the calm, savoring every bite, while inside, thoughts raced like sprinters at a track meet. "Did I send that email? What’s next on my to-do list? Oh, look, cookies!"

By day's end, Alex felt like a phone at 1% battery. Masking took energy. Lots of it. But little did Alex know, a surprise awaited that might just change the game.

As the day danced towards dusk, Jamie found a quiet nook in the office café. Surrounded by the gentle hum of coworkers winding down, she mused over her day of constant 'adhd masking at work'. It was like playing hide and seek with her true self, tucking away her vibrant spontaneity behind a curtain of what she believed was 'professionalism'.

### A Peek Behind the Curtain

Despite these uplifting moments, Jamie couldn't shake the nagging fear of [being found out](/pages/adhd-fear-of-being-found-out/), a whispering worry that her newfound acceptance was just a fragile facade.

Yet, as the stars blinked awake outside, a thought twinkled in Jamie’s mind. What if she let a little of her true colors show? Maybe a playful joke here, a burst of genuine enthusiasm there. Could her unique sparkle not only fit in but actually brighten the workplace tapestry?

The next day, Jamie experimented. She shared a quirky idea in the team meeting, her voice a mix of nerves and excitement. To her delight, it was met with laughter and nods of appreciation. It felt like opening a window in a stuffy room – refreshing and invigorating.

Encouraged, she decided that maybe the office could be another place where she didn't have to hide. Bit by bit, she let her mask slip, revealing more of her true self. And as she did, the office didn’t crumble; it colored.

So, to all the Jamies out there, remember: your true self isn't just acceptable; it’s a breath of fresh air. Let your colors fly; they’re more beautiful than you think!
