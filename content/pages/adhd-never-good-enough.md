Imagine your brain is like a supercharged pinball machine. Lights flash, sounds beep—always buzzing!

Sometimes, that silver ball zooms past the flippers, no matter how quick you flick them.

It feels like you're playing a game where the scores don't quite add up, right?

But hey, guess what? Every game resets with a fresh chance to beat your high score.

Want to hit the play button again and find new strategies together?

In the whimsical town of Buzzlewood, Ellie, a spirited squirrel, was bustling about her treehouse. She was on a mission to organize her vast collection of acorn caps, a task she'd started and restarted fifteen times this month! Each time, Ellie felt that her arrangement was never quite perfect. It was a classic case of feeling like "ADHD never good enough."

Ellie’s treehouse was a splash of color and chaos, with acorn caps scattered like confetti after a parade. Her mind raced faster than a hummingbird’s wings, flitting from one idea to the next. Today, she was determined to sort them by color, size, and shininess.

### A Nutty Dilemma

But no sooner had she started, Ellie’s attention was snagged by a shiny pebble outside her window. "Ooh, that would look fabulous in my collection!" she thought, and off she scampered down the tree.

Back inside, Ellie stared at her half-sorted acorns and sighed. "Maybe I'm just not cut out for this," she muttered, feeling a familiar twinge of frustration. But the day was still young, and Ellie's adventures were far from over.

But back in the story, you see, the idea of "ADHD never good enough" didn't sit well with Captain Focus-a-lot. He seriously thought everyone should feel awesome about their adventures, no matter how wiggly their paths were!

One sunny day, Captain Focus-a-lot invited all his friends for a grand feast in the Heartwood Forest. The table was set not in straight lines but in squiggles, just like their thoughts. Everyone brought something unique to the table—literally!

At that moment, Captain Focus-a-lot gently reminded them that even when they felt the pressure of [ADHD Expectation Vs Reality](/pages/adhd-expectation-vs-reality/), they were all uniquely brilliant in their way.

### A Feast of Ideas

There was Sally with her seven-layer dip of dreams, each layer a different hope she had. Then came Tommy with a pie of puzzles, the crust intricately woven with his latest fixations. And don't forget Jerry, who brought a basket of bouncing blueberry muffins; they seemed to jump right out of the basket with excitement, just like Jerry's thoughts!

As they shared their treats and tales, Captain Focus-a-lot pointed out, "See, every one of us adds something special. It's not about being perfect; it’s about being us!" They nodded, munching and understanding a bit more that their worth wasn't tied to a feeling of never being good enough.

They laughed and planned more squiggly-path adventures, discovering that the journey was full of unexpected treasures. Just like their ADHD, it wasn't a straight line but a delightful doodle!

As the sun set over the hills, Jamie finally understood something important. Their journey with ADHD wasn't about being perfect; it was about being wonderfully, uniquely themselves. "ADHD never good enough?" Jamie chuckled softly. "More like ADHD always good enough in its own special way."

### A Colorful Conclusion

As Jamie reflected on their struggles, they realized that their feelings of never being enough were tied deeply to the [ADHD internalized ableism](/pages/adhd-internalized-ableism/) they had experienced throughout their life.

At the dinner table, Jamie shared their day's adventure. They talked about the dragon, the mountain, and most importantly, how they learned to appreciate their own pace and style. "It's like painting with different colors," Jamie mused, "each one adds something unique."

Mom smiled warmly. "Exactly, Jamie. And remember, every artist has a different brushstroke, just like you have your own way of doing things."

Jamie nodded, feeling lighter and brighter. They realized that the challenge wasn't about changing who they were but embracing it with an open heart. They didn't need to be perfect; they just needed to be Jamie.

And that was more than good enough.
