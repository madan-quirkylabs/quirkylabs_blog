## Why Does ADHD Anxiety Get Worse on Weekends?

Saturday morning came with a to-do list as long as a dragon's tail. Clean the room, finish homework, call Grandma, buy groceries... and oh, find that lost sock! Each task felt like a playful squirrel, scampering out of reach just when Jamie thought they had a grip on it.

Jamie's thoughts raced like sprinters at a track meet. How could they catch up? The clock ticked loudly, adding to the chaos. Tick-tock, tick-tock‚Äîit was like a timer counting down to an unknown blast-off.

In the midst of this whirlwind, Jamie remembered their secret weapon...

When the weekend finally rolls around, it's like the school bell rings and the students‚Äîour thoughts‚Äîrush out into the playground, which is our mind. But instead of playing nicely, they start a game of tag where 'ADHD anxiety on weekends' is always "it". This game can get a little wild, with worries chasing relaxation around until nobody's having fun.

## Coping Strategies for ADHD Weekend Anxiety

In this newfound playground, the fear of stopping doesn't need an invitation, as each fort allows for gentle transitions that acknowledge the [ADHD fear of stopping](/pages/adhd-fear-of-stopping/), letting everyone move at their own comfortable pace.

Imagine if we could give all those thoughts a different game to play, something a bit more calming. Maybe instead of tag, they could play hide and seek, and relaxation could find a super good hiding spot.

To make this game work, we set up little cozy forts made of blankets and pillows around the playground. Each fort has a fun activity or a chill task. One might be a reading nook with comic books. Another could be a mini cinema with short funny videos. And maybe another is just full of squishy stress balls and calming scents.

The thoughts now have options, see? They can choose to dive into a story, laugh at a silly video, or just squeeze a stress ball while sniffing lavender. The game of tag slows down, and 'ADHD anxiety on weekends' starts to lose steam.

But this weekend was different. Jamie had tried a new trick: planning fun, low-stress activities and sticking to them. It was like having a map in a maze; Jamie knew exactly where to turn.

Despite this newfound peace, Jamie couldn't shake off the sensation that [resting felt like failure](/pages/adhd-rest-feels-like-failure/), a nagging guilt for not doing more.
