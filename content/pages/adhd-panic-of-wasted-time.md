Imagine you're a bouncy ball in a giant pinball machine. Ping! There goes another minute. Pong! There goes another plan. You're zipping and zooming from one shiny distraction to the next. Whoosh!

But wait, the clock's hands are like racecar tires, spinning fast. You feel like your whole day just zipped down a drain. Gulp!

But here’s a secret: every bouncy ball can find its cozy corner. What if we gently guide our bouncy ball to a comfy pocket where it can catch its breath? Ready to find that cozy spot together? Let’s bounce back, one playful hop at a time!

Once upon a casual Tuesday, Sammy the squirrel woke up in a flurry. His little mind buzzed like a bee on a sugar rush. He remembered having a whole list of nutty tasks to tackle before winter. But oh, there was a problem. Sammy had spent the whole morning daydreaming and doodling. This led him to a classic case of ADHD panic of wasted time.

Sammy scurried around his tiny treehouse, cheeks puffed, eyes wide. "Too much to do, too little time!" he chirped fretfully.

### Oh Nuts, Where Did the Time Go?

His heart did a bouncy dance as he checked off his to-do list. "Gather acorns, sort leaves, fluff up the nest..." The list seemed to stretch longer than a caterpillar doing yoga!

Sammy stopped, took a deep breath, and looked around. His room was a canvas of chaos, colorful but cluttered. Paints here, acorns there, a half-knit scarf tossed over a chair. "Focus, Sammy, focus!" he whispered to himself.

With a determined twinkle in his eye, he decided to tackle one task at a time.

As the ticking grew louder in Timmy's mind, the "ADHD Panic of Wasted Time" marched in like a parade of clanging pots and pans. He felt every second slip through his fingers like sand in an hourglass, each grain a tiny opportunity vanishing.

Timmy decided to confront the parade. He grabbed his imaginary conductor’s baton and took charge. "Okay, time, let’s dance instead of dash!"

In this newfound rhythm, Timmy also learned to embrace his [ADHD Big Dreams No Follow Through](/pages/adhd-big-dreams-no-follow-through/), seeing each small step as part of a bigger dance, even if the final performance wasn't always clear.

### Making Friends with the Clock

He started by slowing down the march. Instead of rushing from task to task, Timmy took a deep breath. He pictured the clock hands moving to a gentle waltz, not the frantic tap-dance of before.

He set small, shiny goals. Each one was like a star he could reach with a little jump, not a space rocket journey away. Timmy found joy in tiny victories, celebrating each task completed, no matter how small.

By turning the panic into a dance, Timmy learned to step in tune with time, not race against it. Each tick became a beat in his day’s melody, not a boom of doom. The parade quieted, becoming a background rhythm to his colorful, creative day.

As the clock ticked, Sam's worry about the 'ADHD panic of wasted time' bloomed like a stubborn weed. Every tick seemed to echo in his mind, a reminder of time slipping away.

But then, Aunt Mabel, with her twinkling eyes and wise smile, handed Sam a colorful, winding timer. "This," she said, "is your new time adventure tool. It's not just about watching minutes pass, but about making each one count with joy and curiosity."

Amidst these gentle ticks, he also saw the beauty in the [ADHD brilliant but blocked journey](/pages/adhd-brilliant-but-blocked/), understanding that each pause and reflection was a part of his creative process, not just a delay.

### Time Became a Friend, Not a Foe

Sam started using the timer, not as a strict taskmaster, but as a playful companion in his adventures. Each beep became a celebration of what he had achieved, not a scary reminder of what hadn’t been done.

With Aunt Mabel's help, Sam learned to dance with time, not wrestle with it. He found that moments filled with laughter and lessons were never wasted, even if things didn't go as planned.

At the end of the day, Sam realized that time was a canvas, and he was the artist. Whether he painted, paused, or pivoted, it was all valuable. His panic subsided, replaced by a newfound peace and a cheeky readiness to tackle whatever came next.

So, whenever the old worry whispers, Sam smiles and sets his colorful timer. Each tick now says, "You’re doing just fine."
