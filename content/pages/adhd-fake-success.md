Imagine lifeâ€™s like a video game, and every day, you're juggling joysticks. Sometimes, you drop one! Oops.

Today, you nailed a big project presentation. High score! But wait, your bedroomâ€™s a level 10 disaster and your laundryâ€™s still a boss fight waiting to happen.

Everyone claps, thinking you've got all the cheat codes. Inside, you feel like you're mashing buttons, hoping for the best.

Hey, itâ€™s okay. Tomorrow, we level up together, okay? Ready to hit the restart button?

Once upon a time in the bustling town of Brainville, there lived a young squirrel named Sammy. Sammy was not your average squirrel. He had a wild spark in his eyes and energy that made him bounce from one tree to another like a ping-pong ball!

Sammy had a secret, though. He was always worried about keeping up with the other squirrels, who seemed to gather nuts at the speed of light. So, he invented a game called "adhd fake success." He'd stash a few nuts here and there and then act like he found them all in one day. Clever, right?

### The Nutty Show-off

But hereâ€™s the twist! Sammyâ€™s little trick started to make him feel a bit nutty inside. Every time he showed off his pile of nuts, his heart did a funny flip-flop. He knew these weren't really his day's work. He was just zipping and zooming without truly collecting!
 
The other squirrels would clap and cheer, "Wow, Sammy, youâ€™re the fastest nut gatherer in Brainville!" But Sammy knew better. He wasn't really gathering; he was just scattering and pretending. What a pickle!

Continuing our tale, we noticed that ADHD fake success was like a sneaky chameleon. It blended into the background, fooling everyone with its disguise. But little did they know, it wasn't the real deal!

### Mini Mystery: What's Real?

During their quest, Mira often felt like she was just [performing productivity](/pages/adhd-performative-productivity/) rather than truly achieving, a common trap for many with ADHD.

One sunny day, Mira decided to investigate. With her magnifying glass in hand, she peered closer at this so-called "success." What she found was eye-opening! It was all about appearances, not real achievements. Oh, the plot thickens!

Mira shared her findings with her friends. They all had a good laugh about how fooled they were. Then, they set off on a quest to find true success, the kind that felt real and satisfying.

Together, they learned that real success in ADHD land wasn't about hiding or pretending. It was about embracing their unique way of doing things, even if it was a bit zigzaggy or colorful.

They celebrated their discoveries with a grand feast of jelly beans and cupcakes, cheering to their authentic, zigzaggy paths to success! What a sweet ending to a twisty tale!

As our hero basked in the glow of his 'ADHD fake success,' he realized something important. He wasn't just pretending to succeed; he was actually learning how to use his unique ADHD powers. Each small victory, each playful sidestep from distraction, was building a bridge to real achievement.

### Real Success in Disguise!

Despite these accomplishments, he often felt the nagging tug of [ADHD Impostor Syndrome](/pages/adhd-impostor-syndrome/), doubting if his success was deserved or just another trick of his hyperactive mind.

His journey wasn't about faking it till he made it. It was about embracing the chaos, dancing with distraction, and sometimes, turning it into a spectacular fireworks display of creativity and energy. Every stumble, every giggle at his own forgetfulness, added layers to his superpowers.

In the end, our hero found that 'ADHD fake success' wasn't fake at all. It was just success in a sparkly, unusual costume. So, to all the adventurers out there with minds like electric pinball machines, remember: your path might be a scribble, but it's your scribble. Keep scribbling, keep shining, and let your true colors blaze a trail!

To assess if this applies to you, reflect on your achievements and try to recognize the hard work and abilities that contributed to your successes, irrespective of ADHD.
