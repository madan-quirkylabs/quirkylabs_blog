Imagine your brain is like a hyper puppy in a big park—zoomies galore! It races from one shiny thought to the next, never pausing for a breath.

But even though you're zipping through ideas, your energy feels like a phone at 5% battery—still glowing but oh-so-slow.

Yet, every night, when your head hits the pillow, your brain decides it's party time! Thoughts bounce like ping-pong balls, and sleep becomes that sneaky cat hiding just out of reach.

Hey, you’re not alone on this wild ride! Want to join our cozy chat circle where we giggle and share our quirky brain tales?

In the cozy nook of her rainbow-splattered treehouse, Ellie twiddled a pencil like a mini baton. Her brain buzzed like a bee at a flower festival. It was a classic case of 'ADHD wired but tired.' Despite her drooping eyelids, ideas zipped and zapped in her mind like fireflies. She wanted to finish her comic, but also to invent a new recipe for cloud-shaped cookies.

Ellie glanced at her mountain of sketches and sighed. Her thoughts were raccoons at a picnic: curious, scattered, and into everything!

### A Juggling Act in Ellie's Mind

Turning her attention back to the paper, Ellie drew a superhero with sneakers that could sprint up rainbows. "If only I could borrow those for my brain," she giggled, imagining her thoughts racing on colorful arcs.

Her eyes darted to the window. Outside, the stars were like tiny flashlights, guiding her wandering focus back to her comic. Each twinkle seemed to whisper, "Keep going, Ellie!"

Ellie’s pencil danced across the page. Her mind was a wild concert but somehow, she made it play her tune.

So, there we were—the brain squirrels of ADHD-land, fizzing and buzzing like a soda pop left in the sun! They darted up and down the branches of thought, scampering tirelessly. But even the most energetic squirrel needs a break after a wild acorn chase.

### Time for a Tiny Nap?

Even as they nestled into their leafy beds, the squirrels couldn't shake the nagging [ADHD guilt of doing nothing](/pages/adhd-and-guilt-doing-nothing/), feeling uneasy in the stillness that their tired bodies desperately needed.

And that's when it hits: the infamous "ADHD wired but tired." Imagine a bouncy castle deflating slowly, yet there’s still a party inside. The energy? It's there. The ability to use it effectively? Well, that's taking a little snooze.

The brain squirrels, they understand. They've been running on turbo-speed, and now their batteries are flickering low. They want to keep going, to explore every nook and cranny of their treehouse, but their little legs are just too weary.

So, they curl up in their favorite cozy leaf bed, dreaming of giant acorns and endless trees, while their bodies beg for just a few moments of rest. In the world of ADHD, this wired but tired feeling is like being stuck between a dream and daylight, not quite here nor there.

So there we were, in the cozy treehouse, the sun setting like a sleepy orange balloon. I explained to Alex that feeling 'ADHD wired but tired' is like being a superhero whose energy zips around like a pinball, but sometimes crashes into bed like a fallen kite.

"Imagine your energy is a playful puppy," I said, "running around all day, and by night, it just flops down, all tuckered out."

Alex's new understanding whispered softly, like a secret, that it's okay to be a hero who sometimes feels caught in the [ADHD toxic productivity cycle](/pages/adhd-toxic-productivity-cycle/), where resting is as heroic as doing.

Alex giggled, picturing his energy as a puppy.

### Superhero Pajama Party!

Together, we decided that even superheroes need to recharge. "Maybe they wear cozy pajamas and read comic books to relax," Alex suggested, a twinkle in his eyes.

"That's right!" I chuckled. "Even superheroes need their rest to save the world again tomorrow."

As the stars blinked awake outside our treehouse window, Alex looked more at peace. He understood that it's okay to feel both supercharged and super tired. He now knew he could take his cape off, put on his pajamas, and that was perfectly fine.

"Tomorrow, we'll be ready for another adventure," I promised, as he nodded, his fears of the day melting away like marshmallows in hot cocoa.

Rest well, little superhero. Tomorrow is a brand-new day!
