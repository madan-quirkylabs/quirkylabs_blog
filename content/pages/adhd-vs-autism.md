# ADHD vs Autism: How It Feels, and Where It Gets Confusing

Alex always knew his mind worked a little differently — like a radio tuned just a half-step off.

Some days he hyperfocused for hours; other days, simple conversations felt like puzzles missing half their pieces. Was it ADHD? Autism? Both? Neither?

If you've ever wondered why the world feels a little out of sync — and you're searching for real answers without judgment — you're not alone.

Understanding the difference between ADHD vs Autism isn't about fitting into a label. It's about giving yourself hope, clarity, and self-compassion.

## ADHD and Autism Side-by-Side: How to Tell the Difference

Trying to understand the difference between ADHD and Autism sometimes feels like trying to tell apart two rivers — they look separate, but often twist and run close to each other.

For some people, **ADHD** feels like standing in a room where a hundred doors keep swinging open at random, each offering a different adventure — and somehow, you're expected to pick just one.

**Autism**, on the other hand, can feel more like walking through a beautiful, intricate museum — but every sound is turned up to full volume, and the lights are all a little too bright.

Both experiences involve:
- Moments of hyperfocus that make the world disappear
- Struggles with social cues that everyone else seems to know by instinct
- A constant push-and-pull with everyday tasks that others find "easy"

But at the heart:
- **ADHD** is like a compass that spins a little too fast, always looking for the next interesting thing.
- **Autism** is like a deep-rooted map — needing clear paths and predictable patterns to feel safe.

You might see yourself in one, the other, or both.
And that's not something broken — it's something worth understanding.
