Imagine your brain is a playful puppy, always scampering off track. You've just nailed a big project, and your boss is showering you with compliments. "Great job!" she says, and your inner puppy starts sniffing around. "Really? But I missed a spot, didn't I?"

You laugh nervously, shifting from foot to foot like a wind-up toy that can't find its path. "Are you sure you meant me?" you ask, your voice a mixture of hope and doubt.

She smiles, warm and sunny as a picnic day. "Absolutely, I meant every word!"

Come, let's celebrate those wins, big and small, without the shadow of doubt. You're doing awesome, aren't you ready to believe it?

Once upon a bustling brain day, Jamie, who had ADHD, received a compliment. It was a sparkly, shiny one too—about how creatively she solved puzzles. But instead of feeling like a balloon soaring high, Jamie felt like a balloon snagged in a tree. Why? Welcome to the world of ADHD compliment doubt.

Jamie wondered, "Did they really mean it? Or were they just being nice?" Her thoughts raced like a pinball machine, bouncing from doubt to doubt.

### Can Compliments Stick on Teflon?

You see, for Jamie and many others with ADHD, compliments often feel like they're coated in Teflon. They slide right off before they can stick! Jamie's mind was a lively playground, always in motion, making it hard for those nice words to find a place to settle down.

She decided to ask her friend Alex, who shared her ADHD quirks, if this happened to him too. Alex laughed—a big, warm, understanding chuckle. "All the time!" he said. "It's like trying to catch a butterfly with your hands all slippery."

Together, they wondered how to make those compliments stick. Maybe, they thought, it's about believing in the magic of their own unique minds.

When last we left our hero, Sir Fidget of Wigglebottom, he had just received a grand compliment from Queen Focus of the Land of Steadfast. But instead of feeling like a knight in shining armor, Sir Fidget felt more like a knight in slightly rattling armor. Ah, the classic case of ADHD compliment doubt!

Sir Fidget's mind was a whirlwind, tossing the compliment around like a leaf caught in a playful breeze. "Surely, she jests," he thought, scratching his head under his helmet which was, incidentally, a bit too big and made a 'clunk' sound every time he moved too fast.

Often, this doubt is a shadow of [ADHD Impostor Syndrome](/pages/adhd-impostor-syndrome/), which whispers that you're not really as capable as others believe.

### A Knightly Conundrum

"Why would the Queen compliment me?" he pondered aloud. "I'm more likely to forget my sword than slay a dragon!"

Little did he know, his squire, Page Turner, had overheard him. Page Turner, a wise young fellow, stepped forth, balancing a stack of books. "Sir Fidget," he said, "everyone sees your bravery and good deeds. It's just you who doubts."

"But what if they're just being nice?" Sir Fidget fretted, fiddling with his gauntlet.

Page Turner chuckled, "Sir, even knights need a pat on the back sometimes. It doesn't make the compliment any less true!"

With a small smile, Sir Fidget considered this. Maybe, just maybe, he could start to see what others saw in him. Maybe he could believe in the knight reflected in the polished surface of his slightly oversized armor. After all, every knight has his doubts, but it takes a true hero to battle them.

As the day wound down, Jamie's mind still buzzed with thoughts about the ADHD compliment doubt. They couldn't shake the feeling that maybe they didn't really deserve the praise they'd received. But as they sat quietly, watching the sunset paint the sky in shades of orange and pink, a calm realization washed over them.

"Maybe it's not about deserving," Jamie murmured to themselves, "but about accepting." They smiled, thinking of how the colors in the sky didn't doubt whether they deserved to be beautiful; they just were.

This gentle acceptance helped to ease the often gnawing **[ADHD impostor syndrome](/pages/adhd-impostor-syndrome/)** that usually whispered doubts with each word of praise.

### Let's Paint Our Own Sky!

The next day, Jamie decided to start a small journal, documenting every compliment they received, ADHD and all. Each entry was a colorful splash on the pages, a reminder of their own unique hues.

By the end of the week, the journal was bursting with bits of joy. Jamie realized that each compliment was a brush stroke in the masterpiece of their life. No doubts needed, just appreciation for the art.

"Compliments are gifts," Jamie concluded, "and I'm going to keep unwrapping each one with gratitude."

Jamie's heart felt lighter, and for the first time in a long time, they truly believed in the brightness of their own canvas. They knew that every compliment was a true reflection of who they were, vibrant and remarkable, just like the sunset.

## Quickfire ADHD Checklist
