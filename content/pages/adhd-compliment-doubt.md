Imagine your brain is like a super-busy bee, buzzing from one flower to another. Now, someone hands you a golden trophy saying, “Best Bee!” But inside, you’re wondering, “Really? Me?”

Sometimes, when people give us compliments, it feels like trying to catch butterflies with a net full of holes. You might think, “I can’t even hold onto one thought, how can I be awesome?”

But here’s the thing: every buzzing bee and fluttering butterfly is part of the beautiful chaos that makes you, you. And yes, you are awesome, trophy or no trophy.

So, next time someone gives you a compliment, try imagining it as a cool sticker for your collection. Who doesn’t love stickers, right? Let’s start believing them, one shiny sticker at a time.

Once upon a time in the bustling town of Brainwave, there lived a quirky little thought named Ada. Ada was known for her sparkly energy and her special ability—she had ADHD, making her zip around like a bee in a garden of wildflowers. But Ada had a little shadow called ADHD compliment doubt, which made accepting kind words as tricky as catching soap bubbles.

Whenever someone gave Ada a compliment, like "Your ideas are as bright as fireworks!" her doubt would whisper, "Are they really, or are they just being nice?" It was like having an itch in a spot she couldn’t scratch—super annoying!

### A Doubtful Shadow in a Sunny Town

One sunny day, Ada decided she’d had enough. She was going to find out why compliments felt as slippery as a bar of wet soap. So, she put on her detective hat, a bright red cap with a floppy brim, and strolled into the heart of Brainwave, determined to solve this mystery.

So, imagine you're a detective in the bustling city of Brainopolis. Your mission? To investigate the curious case of ADHD compliment doubt.

ADHD compliment doubt is like a sneaky cat. It hides under the bed when you try to find it. It happens when people with ADHD struggle to believe nice things said about them. They might think, "Are they just being nice? Do I really deserve that compliment?"

Feeling like a superhero was hard, especially when whispers of [ADHD impostor syndrome](/pages/adhd-impostor-syndrome/) echoed every accolade, questioning their authenticity even more.

### A Clue in the Cookie Jar

Let's zoom in on our detective, who just received a compliment from a fellow detective about solving a tricky puzzle. Instead of feeling like a superhero, our detective wonders if it's just a polite fib.

"Why would they say that?" our detective mutters, munching on a cookie. Cookies always help in thinking, right? Each bite brings a new thought. "Am I really good, or are they just being kind?"

Our detective decides it's time for some sleuthing! With a magnifying glass in one hand and a cookie in the other, it's time to uncover the truth behind these compliments. Can they be trusted? Are they as sweet as they seem?

Stay tuned as we dive deeper into the mystery of believing in oneself!

So, back to our journey through the forest of ADHD compliment doubt. Remember how our friend felt when they couldn't believe the nice things said about them? They felt like a knight unsure if their armor was shiny enough.

But as they journeyed on, they learned something important. Every compliment is like a little sparkler. Even if it feels too bright or surprising, it's meant to light up their day!

This newfound comfort with compliments was a small, yet significant step away from the **[ADHD impostor syndrome](/pages/adhd-impostor-syndrome/)** that often whispered doubts in their ear.

### Let's Light Up!

Our knight finally realized that their armor did indeed shine brightly. It wasn’t just pretend shine, but real, sparkling-under-the-sunshine shine. They started to see compliments as gifts, not tricks.

They practiced saying "Thank you" instead of "Are you sure?" It felt good. Really good.

So, if you ever feel that nagging doubt when someone says something nice, remember our knight. Maybe your armor is shinier than you think. Embrace the sparkle. Shine on, brave knight, shine on!
