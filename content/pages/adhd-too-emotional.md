Imagine your feelings are like a basket of puppies—cute, wiggly, and all over the place! One minute you're laughing, the next you're sniffling, all because one puppy licked your nose and then scampered away.

Sometimes, it feels like you're juggling colorful balloons in a breezy park. Up, down, and oops—there goes a blue one, soaring into the clouds because something exciting just happened!

But hey, it's okay. What if we could gather all those runaway balloons, sit down together, and share stories about where they floated off to? Let’s chat and giggle about our balloon adventures, shall we?

Once upon a sunny afternoon, Billy, a bunny with bouncy ADHD, was having a bit of a rollercoaster day. His emotions were like popcorn kernels in a hot pan—popping up fast and furious! One moment he was giggling over a silly joke, the next he was frowning at a puzzle piece that just wouldn’t fit.

"Why are you always up and down, Billy?" asked his friend, a wise old turtle named Tim. "It's like your feelings are on a super speedy slide!"

Billy sighed, his ears flopping. "I guess it's just my ADHD being too emotional today."

##	How ADHD Turns Emotions Into Rollercoasters (And What Helps)

Tim nodded slowly. "ADHD can make your feelings big and bouncy, huh?"

"Yeah," Billy agreed, a smile peeking through. "Sometimes it's like riding a giant wave!" 

They decided to make a game of it. Every time Billy felt a big emotion, he’d say what color it felt like. Anger was red. Happiness, bright yellow. Sadness, a deep blue. 

"Look, Tim! Now I’m surfing the yellow!" Billy laughed, twirling around.

When we last left Piper, she was zooming around like a hyper hummingbird, collecting feelings like shiny treasures. You see, for Piper, having ADHD meant she often felt emotions more intensely. This is what some folks call "ADHD too emotional." Her heart didn’t just flutter; it did gymnastics!

## Why ADHD Makes You Feel Everything So Deeply

Amidst these highs and lows, Piper often wondered if her intense emotions made her [ADHD too much for others](/pages/adhd-too-much-for-others/), yet she kept dancing to her unique tune.

One moment, Piper was on top of the world, laughing as she swung higher and higher. The next moment, she felt like her swing had suddenly dropped. Sadness would wash over her without any warning.

But Piper had a secret weapon: her magic backpack. It wasn’t just any backpack; it was a super special sort of bag that helped her carry all her big feelings. Inside, there were pockets filled with bright crayons for drawing smiles on sad days and a soft, fluffy blanket to wrap herself in when the world felt too loud.

Her teacher, Mr. Wise, noticed how quickly Piper's emotions changed. He taught her to name each feeling as it appeared, like greeting a new friend. "Hello, Happiness! What brings you here?" "Oh no, Sadness, what’s up?" This helped Piper feel like she was in control of her own magical, emotional adventure.

Piper learned that every emotion was like a note in her life’s song. Sometimes the notes were high, sometimes they were low, but all of them together made her music beautiful. Piper danced to her own rhythm, with her magic backpack jingling along, full of tools to help her navigate the colorful world of feelings.

By the end of the week, Lily noticed a pattern. Whenever she felt overwhelmed, her emotions, supercharged by her ADHD, seemed to dance like popping popcorn. It was like her feelings were on a bouncy castle, leaping higher with every bounce.

## ADHD, Emotions, and Finding Your Rainbow After the Storm

Amid her reflections, Lily couldn't shake off the nagging [ADHD fear of rejection](/pages/adhd-fear-of-rejection/), wondering if her intense emotions made her too much to handle for others.

Lily decided to make a change. She started a journal, noting down what made her popcorn pop too high. She also talked more with her mom, who was like a gentle anchor, keeping her grounded.

One sunny afternoon, Lily sat under her favorite tree. She realized that her whirlwind of emotions, though sometimes too intense, also made her uniquely creative and empathetic. Her ADHD wasn't just a box of wild emotions; it was a treasure chest of sparkling feelings.

She smiled, feeling more in tune with herself. "It's okay to be a storm sometimes," she thought, "as long as I remember my rainbow afterward."

Embrace your storms, for they bring out your brightest rainbows!
