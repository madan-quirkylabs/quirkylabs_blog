Imagine your brain is a bouncy castle at a busy party, full of jumping ideas. Sometimes, though, it feels like all the air just whooshes out. Pffft!

You want to play, to jump with the rest, but your feet are stuck in sticky, slow-moving molasses. Everyone else seems to zip and zap, and there you are, just wishing you could move.

But hey, what if you could find a secret, silly dance to wiggle your toes free? Let's try turning that slow molasses into a super slide. Ready to glide through with a grin?

Once upon a time, in the bustling village of Mindville, lived Ziggy the Zebra, known for his dazzling, zig-zag stripes. Ziggy also had ADHD, which sometimes made tasks feel like climbing a giant jelly mountain. On sunny days, he felt like a superhero, zipping from one adventure to the next. But there were also gloomy days where ADHD made Ziggy feel lazy, even when he wanted to gallop and play.

### Can You Feel the Slow-Mo?

On one such slow-mo day, Ziggy found himself sprawled on the comfy grass under the big banana tree, watching clouds drift by like fluffy marshmallows in a hot cocoa sky. Thoughts popped like popcorn in his mind. "I should be jumping with Jerry Giraffe," he sighed, watching a butterfly flit past, its wings a blur of color. But his legs felt like they were filled with peanut butter, heavy and sticky.

"Hey Ziggy!" chirped Dotty the Dragonfly, zooming over with a sparkle in her eye. "Why so glum, chum?" She hovered, her wings a hummingbird's envy.

So, here's the thing about our friend Sam, the squirrel, who people sometimes think feels lazy because of his ADHD. It's not about being lazy at all! In fact, Sam is like a supercharged rocket that sometimes doesn't know where to fly next. Picture this: Sam wakes up, excited to start the day. He has a big list: collect acorns, tidy up the treehouse, visit friends, and maybe start a new hobby—leaf painting!

**A Squirrel's Busy Brain**

Often, this whirlwind of thoughts leads Sam to battle feelings of being [never good enough](/pages/adhd-never-good-enough/), as he struggles to meet his own adventurous expectations.

But here's where it gets nutty. Sam looks at the acorns, then the messy treehouse, thinks about visiting Benny Beaver, and suddenly, he's overwhelmed. He feels stuck, like a little squirrel glued to his branch. It's not that he doesn't want to move; he just can't decide which way to jump first!

Sam starts to collect acorns but then zips back, worried he forgot something at home. Halfway through cleaning, he's brainstorming the perfect color for his leaf painting. His brain is like a pinball machine, bouncing from one idea to another.

To someone watching, it might seem like Sam is just lazing about or daydreaming. But inside, his mind is running a marathon! That's the tricky thing about feeling 'lazy' when you have ADHD. It's really a mix-up in managing all the exciting plans and ideas. 

So, next time you see Sam staring into space, remember, he's probably sorting through a whirlwind of thoughts, trying to figure out the best path to take. And who knows? Maybe he'll invent a new game or find a hidden treasure on his adventures. After all, every big journey starts with a single, sometimes hesitant, leap!

Tommy had learned a lot about why sometimes people with ADHD feel lazy. It wasn't laziness at all; it was like their brain had too many tabs open, making it hard to focus on just one. His teacher, Mr. Lemon, explained it with a gentle smile, "ADHD can make you feel like you're in a slow-motion video sometimes, even when you want to go fast."

Tommy thought that was a funny way to think about it. He imagined his brain as a busy bee that needed short breaks to make the best honey.

Tommy also learned that many kids with ADHD, like him, often struggle with feeling as though they're always in trouble, which can be quite exhausting and discouraging over time.

### A Little Bee's Break

The next day, Tommy tried something new. During homework, he took short breaks to stretch and jump, just like the breaks a bee takes when gathering pollen from different flowers. To his surprise, it helped! He completed his homework faster than ever before.

Tommy shared his discovery with his class. Everyone clapped, and Mr. Lemon gave him a thumbs-up. "See, you've found your rhythm, just like a good dancer finds the beat!"

Tommy felt proud. He knew that with a few little tweaks, he could manage his ADHD. It wasn't about being lazy; it was about learning how to dance to his own beat.

"Remember, we're all different," Mr. Lemon concluded, "and that's what makes each of us special."

Tommy went home smiling. He was ready to dance through every day, even on the slow ones. He knew he wasn't alone, and that felt like the warmest, sunniest spot in the garden.
