Imagine you're a bouncy kangaroo, hopping from one task to another. First, you're drawing, next, you're building a LEGO tower. Oh, shiny!

But wait, each hop leaves a half-finished masterpiece behind. A puzzle missing its last piece, a storybook left wide open.

It might feel like your pockets are full of unfinished symphonies, huh? But every note you played, every block you stacked, was a step in your dance.

What if, together, we find a way to link those hops into a full-on kangaroo dance? Let's hop back and maybe finish one old tune?

Imagine you're in a room stuffed with the coolest toys you can think of. There's a half-painted canvas in one corner, a half-built robot in another, and a guitar with a tune only half learned. This is what it often feels like inside the mind of Jamie, who has ADHD. Jamie starts lots of projects but finishing them? That's another story. It's like each idea is a shiny comet zooming by, and Jamie can't help but chase the next one before the last one has landed.

## ADHD and Starting But Not Finishing: Why It‚Äôs Hard & What Helps

One sunny afternoon, Jamie decided to bake cookies. By the time the oven was preheated, Jamie was outside, intrigued by a butterfly, then inside drawing the butterfly, then suddenly organizing a drawer found while looking for a sketchbook, which was under a pile of other unfinished projects. Each new spark of interest was as irresistible as a cat chasing a laser pointer.

When we last saw our hero, the Ever-Distracted Knight, he was on a quest to complete the Great Project. But as with many heroes who understand the saga of 'ADHD finishing nothing', distractions were as common as dragons in a fairy tale.

The Knight stumbled upon a glittering stream where ideas flowed like sparkling water. Each idea shone brighter than the last, tempting him to scoop them up. But oh, the Great Project was waiting! Yet, each shiny new thought led him further from his path.

Amid these sparkling distractions, the Knight's big dreams often seemed just out of reach, a constant reminder of the [ADHD Big Dreams No Follow Through](/pages/adhd-big-dreams-no-follow-through/) challenge many face.

## ADHD Task Completion: How to Stay Focused Through to the End

Determined, our Knight set a tiny, playful timer, a magical artifact known as the Pomodoro Pebble. It promised bursts of focus, short and sweet. "Just 25 minutes!" the Pebble chirped. The Knight agreed, setting off with renewed vigor each time the pebble sang its time-up tune.

But alas, as the sun set, the Knight found himself crafting a magnificent boat instead of finishing the bridge that was part of his Great Project. The boat was not planned, but oh, how it gleamed under the twilight!

Tomorrow, he thought, I'll steer this boat back to the bridge. With each dawn, hope renewed, and our Knight learned that finishing isn't just about the end; it's about finding joy in all the 'unfinished' adventures along the way.

As the sun began to set over the neighborhood, Sammy finally understood why they often felt like they were finishing nothing. It wasn't because they didn't care or weren't trying hard enough. Their ADHD brain just liked to juggle many balls at once, and sometimes a few would drop.

Sammy decided to see each new day as a fresh start. They would try little tricks to stay on track, like breaking tasks into smaller chunks and celebrating small victories. And with each small step, the mountain of unfinished projects seemed a bit less daunting.

Reflecting on their journey, Sammy felt a poignant sense of relief, realizing this pattern wasn't unique to them but a common thread among many, often described as [ADHD unfinished projects](/pages/adhd-unfinished-projects/).

## ADHD and Project Overload: How to Make Finishing Feel Possible

Sammy shared their feelings with friends, who were more supportive than expected. Together, they made a game of finishing tasks. It was like a race, but everyone cheered for each other, no matter who finished first.

In the end, Sammy realized that it's okay to go at their own pace. They might not finish everything they start right away, but with a smile and a bit of persistence, they'll get there. And that's perfectly fine.
