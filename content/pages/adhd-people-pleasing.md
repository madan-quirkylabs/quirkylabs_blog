Imagine you're a super-busy bee, buzzing from one colorful flower to another. You don't want to miss a single one because hey, they might feel left out!

Now, picture wearing roller skates in a bustling kitchen. You're zipping around, balancing plates and cups‚Äîoops, don't let anything crash!

It's tiring, right? But guess what? It's okay to park those skates and just enjoy the party.

Why not join us in the comfy corner? Let's chat and recharge. Everyone's welcome here!

Once upon a bubbly afternoon, Sammy Squirrel was scampering through the vibrant forest of Fidget Ferns. Sammy, famous among forest friends for his shimmering, ever-changing focus, had a little secret. He was the king of ADHD people pleasing. Always zigzagging from tree to tree, eager to help every critter with their nutty problems.

Today, Sammy had a mission! Mrs. Owl needed her nest reorganized. Mr. Beaver wanted help building a dam. And the Bunny family was hosting a hop-dance that needed an extra judge.

### Sammy's Super Squirrel Services

Sammy started with Mrs. Owl's towering tree home. He tidied with twirls, fluffs flying like a mini tornado. Next, he dashed to Mr. Beaver‚Äôs brook, balancing bark and twigs with acrobatic ease. Finally, he hopped over to judge the Bunny hop-dance, his eyes sparkling with excitement at each bunny bounce.

Sammy loved feeling needed. His tail wagged faster with every thank you. But deep down in his furry little heart, Sammy wondered if he ever said yes too much.

When we left off, Captain Focus had just realized that his spaceship, The Pleaser, was trying a bit too hard to keep everyone in the galaxy happy. It's a common thing with ADHD people pleasing. They zoom around, trying to make sure every star and planet feels special, often forgetting to check their own fuel levels.

Captain Focus decided it was time for a tune-up. He flew The Pleaser to the nearest space station, a cozy little spot known for its understanding mechanics and soothing lounge music.

At the space station, he also confided in Blinky about his nagging feeling of not doing enough or being enough, which is often intensified by [ADHD impostor syndrome](/pages/adhd-impostor-syndrome/).

### Tune-Up Time!

At the station, the mechanic, a wise old robot named Blinky, listened to Captain Focus's concerns. "You've got to remember to balance your thrusters," Blinky advised, tapping on The Pleaser's dashboard. "It‚Äôs easy to burn out if you're always accelerating to please others."

Captain Focus nodded. He'd been zooming from one task to another, brightening up every corner of the universe, but sometimes he forgot to shine a little light on himself.

Blinky installed a new gadget in The Pleaser: a reminder system that pinged whenever the fuel levels dipped too low or if Captain Focus had skipped his relaxation protocol. "It‚Äôs important to recharge, not just for you but for the whole crew," Blinky reminded him.

As Captain Focus waved goodbye, he felt lighter, like a comet that had just tossed off some unnecessary ice. He was ready to navigate the cosmos with a healthier approach to helping others and himself. In the vast universe of interactions, he would now be his own star as well, glowing steadily and warmly.

After a whirlwind of activities and eager attempts to please everyone, Jamie finally took a moment to breathe. Sitting under the old oak tree in their backyard, they realized something important. Even with ADHD people pleasing tendencies, they could still set boundaries and take care of themselves.

Jamie decided it was okay to say no sometimes. They didn't have to juggle everyone else's happiness on their shoulders. It was like trying to carry a basket of laughing, jumping puppies. Fun but exhausting!

Amid these revelations, Jamie also contemplated how their [ADHD impostor syndrome](/pages/adhd-impostor-syndrome/) often made them doubt their genuine need for downtime, confusing self-care with selfishness.

### A Basket of Puppies

The next day, Jamie started small. They told their friend they couldn‚Äôt hang out because they needed some alone time. It felt weird but good. Like wearing a new pair of shoes that you need to break in.

Their friend understood and even appreciated Jamie's honesty. It was a relief! Jamie felt lighter, as if they had put down a heavy backpack after a long hike.

From then on, Jamie made sure to check in with themselves. Were they saying yes because they wanted to, or because they felt they had to? Each decision was a step towards a happier, healthier life.

It‚Äôs okay to take care of yourself too. Remember, even superheroes need a break!

## Quickfire ADHD Checklist

1. üé≠ Imagine juggling flaming torches ‚Äî that's your ADHD people-pleasing. Drop one; it‚Äôs okay!

2. üç™ Think of saying "no" as choosing your favorite cookie. You deserve the best one!

3. üåà Set boundaries like you're drawing with bright sidewalk chalk. Color outside the lines sometimes!

4. üê¢ Slow down! You‚Äôre not a racehorse at the derby; more like a cozy, thoughtful turtle.
