Imagine you're a bouncy kangaroo, hopping from one friend to another. Fun, right? But uh-oh, what if one friend doesn’t smile back?

Sometimes, your brain feels like a pinball machine. Thoughts ping and pong, especially scary ones like "What if they don’t like me?"

But hey, every pinball game resets, and so can you. Next round, you might just hit the high score of friendship!

Wanna hop into learning how to bounce back together?

Once upon a sunny afternoon, Jamie dashed through the park like a squirrel chasing its shadow. With twigs in her hair and a grin wide as a canyon, she was the picture of wild, carefree joy. But deep down, a storm brewed—Jamie had ADHD and often felt a sharp sting, the ADHD fear of rejection, whenever she tried connecting with new friends.

"Why don't they laugh at my jokes?" she pondered, tossing a pine cone into the air.

## ADHD Rejection Sensitivity: Why It Hurts So Deeply

She imagined each pine cone was a tiny spaceship. "Off to explore unknown galaxies!" she exclaimed, watching it plummet instead. Just like her attempts to make friends, soaring high then suddenly dropping.

Every giggle or whisper she saw from afar felt like coded messages. "Do they like me? Do they think I'm weird?" These questions buzzed in her mind like bees around a soda can. 

Jamie's thoughts spun faster than a merry-go-round. It was exhausting. Every invitation she didn't get felt like a personal slight, a tiny confirmation of her biggest worry: "What if I'm just too much?"

So, there’s our little hero, Captain Brainwave, zooming through Brainopolis. He's on a mission to fight the sneaky villain known as the ADHD Fear of Rejection. This villain is as slippery as a bar of soap in a bathtub! It makes Captain Brainwave worry that his friends might not like his unique, super-fast superhero style.

## How ADHD Impacts Friendships and Triggers Fear of Being Left Out

Amid his excitement and nerves, Captain Brainwave also battled the nagging worry that he might be [ADHD Too Much For Others](/pages/adhd-too-much-for-others), fearing his energetic nature could overwhelm his pals.

One sunny day, Captain Brainwave planned a big party at his treehouse. He whipped up his favorite snacks and decorated with glittering lights. But oh, that sneaky fear started to whisper, "What if nobody comes? What if they don't like your party?"

Captain Brainwave shook his head, trying to shoo away the worry. He remembered all the times his friends had a blast zooming around with him. "I've got this!" he exclaimed, puffing out his chest like a proud pigeon.

As the clock ticked closer to party time, his heart played hopscotch in his chest. But then, the doorbell rang. One by one, his friends flew in, each with a bigger smile than the last. They loved the party! They even said his treehouse was the coolest clubhouse in Brainopolis.

Captain Brainwave learned that day that his fear, although loud and pesky, didn't control his story. He realized that his friends loved him for his zoomy, zappy, wonderfully wacky self. And just like that, the ADHD Fear of Rejection got a little smaller, like a balloon slowly losing air.

Remember, even superheroes have fears, but they don't have to fly solo. Friends can be like sidekicks, helping you fight the baddies and celebrate the victories!

As the sun set on another adventure, Sam realized something important. The fear of rejection, a shadow that often followed those with ADHD like a mischievous tail, wasn't as big and scary as it seemed. It was just a pesky cloud that sometimes blocked the sun.

Sam learned to see it differently, thanks to the support of friends like Mia and Leo. Together, they discovered that rejection is just a moment, not a forever.

Amidst all this, Sam also confronted a deeper, nagging fear, often wondering, [am I too much for others?](/pages/adhd-too-much-for-others/)

## Rebuilding Confidence After Rejection with ADHD

One sunny afternoon, as they watched the clouds drift by, Mia shared a secret. "Every cloud has a silver lining," she said, "even the ones that rain on our parade!" They all laughed, realizing that even when things go wrong, there's always a chance to try again.

With new confidence, Sam decided to treat rejection like a game of dodgeball. Sometimes you get hit, but it's all in good fun, and you always get another chance to throw the ball.

So, under the golden rays of another day, Sam and friends skipped forward. With each step, they left little sparks of joy and courage on the path behind them. They knew now that fear was part of the journey, but it wasn't the map. 

Keep playing, keep laughing, and remember, every stumble is just a new dance move you haven't mastered yet!
