Imagine you're a buzzing bee, always zooming from one flower to the next. But sometimes, even bees need to sit on a petal and just breathe.

But oh no! When you stop, it feels like you're forgetting how to fly. Like every other bee is zipping by, collecting nectar, and you're just... sitting.

It‚Äôs not really a break, feels more like you're stuck in slow-mo while the world is on fast-forward.

But here‚Äôs a little secret: even superheroes rest in their cozy hideouts. It‚Äôs okay to pause your super-mission.

Let's find that comfy petal and take a breather together. Ready to be still and recharge? üåº

Meet Milo, a whirlwind of energy and ideas with bouncing feet and a giggle that could light up a room. He‚Äôs got ADHD, like a superhero with a cape made of bouncy balls. Each day, he zooms through tasks and thoughts, fast and furious.

One quiet Saturday, Milo found himself slumped on his cozy bean bag. The world outside buzzed along, but inside, Milo felt stuck. His brain whispered, ‚ÄúTake a rest,‚Äù but his heart countered, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs like giving up!‚Äù Yes, for Milo, ADHD rest feels like failure.

### A Cozy Conundrum

Milo wrestled with the quiet. Resting felt as odd as wearing socks on his hands! He wondered why pausing felt so wrong, even when his mind craved a break.

When our hero, Wiggly Wabbit, finally sat down in his cozy burrow, his mind buzzed like a hyperactive bee. He thought, "Why am I sitting? I should be doing things! All this resting feels like I'm failing at being productive."

But then, the Wise Old Owl from the tree next door hooted softly, "Wiggly, rest isn't failure. It's like recharging your superpowers."

As Wiggly Wabbit's restful evening continued, he couldn't help but feel haunted by a familiar sensation, a creeping [ADHD guilt doing nothing](/pages/adhd-and-guilt-doing-nothing/) that nagged at him, questioning his lack of activity.

### Rest is Recharging!

Wiggly pondered this as he nibbled on a carrot. "Maybe resting isn't so bad. Maybe it's like a secret potion that makes my superpowers even stronger."

He watched the sun set, feeling a bit more at peace. Resting could be his new secret weapon.

In our story, Jamie finally understood why ADHD rest feels like failure. It was like trying to pause an exciting movie right at the climax‚Äîevery cell in her body screamed to keep going!

But with her new tools, Jamie learned to embrace rest. She imagined it as recharging her superpowers. Each pause was a pit stop in her adventure race, essential for keeping her engine roaring!

Jamie also realized that her inability to enjoy these quiet moments was deeply linked to her struggle with [ADHD and guilt doing nothing](/pages/adhd-and-guilt-doing-nothing/), making each pause feel like a battle she was losing.

### Super Jamie Takes a Break!

Now, Jamie had a secret weapon: her rest routine. She curled up with her cat, Mr. Whiskers, and a good book, letting the quiet moments mend her mental muscles.

Jamie discovered that rest wasn't her enemy. It was her ally, whispering secrets of strength and renewal. She could face each day with a smile, ready to zoom again. And whenever the guilt crept in, she‚Äôd remind herself: "Even superheroes need to recharge!"

So take that break, recharge those superpowers, and remember: every hero needs their rest.

## Quickfire ADHD Checklist

3. üê¢ Ever seen a turtle snooze in its shell? Cozy, right? Channel your inner turtle.
