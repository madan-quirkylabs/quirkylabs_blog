Imagine your brain is like a super-busy train station. Trains zooming everywhere! Now, picture your favorite train â€” the one carrying all your pals â€” suddenly disappears into a tunnel. Oh no, where did it go?

You wait and wait, tapping your foot, worrying it might not come back. It's like when you misplace your favorite toy and can't focus on anything else until you find it.

But hey, guess what? The train rolls back, friends waving out the windows! Sometimes things disappear for a bit, but they often come right back. And even if they don't, thereâ€™s always a new train arriving with new adventures and new buddies.

Feeling a bit wobbly about people coming and going? Letâ€™s chat about it, find the fun in every hello and goodbye!

Lucy had a mind like a butterfly gardenâ€”colorful, fluttery, and always a bit chaotic. One sunny afternoon, in the midst of a glittering idea shower, Lucy's best friend, Max, texted her. But oops! She forgot to reply. Again. Her thoughts were slippery fish, and sometimes important things slipped right through.

The next day, Lucy felt a familiar pang. It was her ADHD fear of abandonment, buzzing like a pesky mosquito. What if Max thought she didn't care? What if he didn't want to be friends anymore?

### A Mindful Misadventure

Lucy decided to tackle the problem head-on. She grabbed her polka-dotted boots and a notebook. "To Max's house!" she declared with a superhero's gusto.

She scribbled down her thoughts as they zoomed by:
1. "Sorry for the silent treatment!"
2. "Brain like a pinball machine!"
3. "Still friends?"

Short. Sweet. To the point. Lucy felt a bit better with each step.

When we last left our hero, Sparky, the neon squirrel, he was zipping through the forest of Focus, dodging distractions and hoarding nuts for the winter. But despite his busy schedule, there was a nagging fear that tugged at his fluffy tailâ€”a fear many with ADHD share: the fear of abandonment.

Sparky worried his forest friends might one day disappear, leaving him to scurry alone. It wasn't that his friends had ever hinted at leaving; it was just a shadow that sometimes darkened his sunny days.

In his heart, Sparky also harbored a nagging worry that he was [too much for his friends](/pages/adhd-too-much-for-others/), a common feeling among those with ADHD, which made his treasure map plan feel even more crucial.

### A Nutty Solution

Sparky had an idea! "What if I create a treasure map?" he thought. "A map that leads to my stash of nuts, but also to fun places in our forest!" By sharing his map, he hoped to remind his friends of all the fun they had together.

Each landmark was a memory they shared: the Great Oak they climbed last spring, the Hidden Creek where they had splashed around during the summer, and the Hilltop where they watched the stars.

Through this map, Sparky showed his friends how important they were to him and how each adventure they had was a treasure in itself. His clever plan was more than just a way to share his nuts; it was a way to keep his friends close, anchoring them with shared memories and ongoing plans.

His friends loved the idea, and each promised to add their own favorite spots to the map, turning it into a living story of their friendships. As they all chattered excitedly, planning new adventures, Sparky felt that shadow of fear shrink away, replaced by the warm glow of connectedness.

By facing his fear creatively, Sparky learned that the bonds of friendship, like the roots of the Great Oak, were deep and strong. And just like that, the forest of Focus felt a little more like home.

As the sky painted itself with shades of twilight, Jamie and Luna sat under the old oak tree. They had shared stories and giggles, weaving a blanket of trust that felt cozy and warm. Jamie realized that her ADHD fear of abandonment, like a shadow, wasn't so scary when someone understood.

"Hey, Luna," Jamie whispered, her voice as soft as a breeze, "thanks for staying."

Jamie couldn't help but often feel she was [ADHD Too Much For Others](/pages/adhd-too-much-for-others/), but Luna's reassuring presence helped soothe that nagging doubt.

Luna smiled, her eyes twinkling like stars. "I'm here, always."

### Stars Can't Shine Without Darkness

They promised to support each other, no matter what. Every fear seemed smaller, every joy bigger.

"Let's chase fireflies," Luna suggested, and they did, laughter echoing under the moonlit sky.

Together, they learned that friendship was the light that made the dark less daunting. Jamie felt her worries melt away like marshmallows in hot chocolate. She knew with Luna by her side, she was never really alone.

So, if you ever feel a breeze of loneliness, remember Jamie and Luna. Find your Luna, share your story, and watch the stars come out. You're not alone. Not really. Not ever.
