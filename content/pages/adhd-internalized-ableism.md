Imagine your brain is a bouncy castle. Thoughts jump and flip wildly, not always landing where they should. It's a fun mess!

Sometimes, though, you scold the castle for being too bouncy. "Why can't you just sit still like a nice, quiet library?" you wonder.

But hey, libraries and bouncy castles both rock‚Äîthey're just different! Maybe it's time to enjoy the bounce instead of wishing for quiet aisles.

What if you celebrated each wild leap? Imagine the fun, the creativity! Let's bounce to a beat that feels just right.

In the whimsical town of Mindwell, everyone's brain worked a bit like a super-charged pinball machine. Especially Max's. Max had ADHD, and sometimes, he felt like his thoughts were popping popcorn at a carnival ‚Äî fast, furious, and fun! But not all days were a carnival ride.

Max often found himself tripping over a sneaky little thing called ADHD internalized ableism. It was like having an invisible backpack that sometimes filled with stones when people misunderstood his zippy brain.

## ADHD Internalized Ableism: How Society‚Äôs Shame Weighs Down Your Spark

One sunny afternoon, Max decided to build the world's most magnificent Lego castle. Colors everywhere! His fingers danced from one brick to another, creating towers and turrets at lightning speed. He was in his element, his brain buzzing happily along.

But then, Aunt Mindy peered over his shoulder. "Max, shouldn't you slow down? Maybe focus on one thing?"

Max's smile drooped a bit. The stones in his backpack felt heavier. He wondered, was his fast-brain way of doing things really wrong?

But then, his cat Whiskers knocked over a Lego tower. Max laughed. The tower could be rebuilt, just like he could keep reshaping his thoughts. Maybe his way of thinking wasn't a mess but a masterpiece in progress!

When we last left Max, the curious cat with a penchant for climbing trees, he was just realizing that not all cats climb trees in the same way. Max, as we know, has ADHD, which makes him unique in how he approaches his adventures. Today, Max was feeling a bit gloomy because he had heard some older cats whispering that "proper cats" don't get distracted by butterflies or forget why they climbed the tree in the first place.

## Overcoming ADHD Shame: Why You‚Äôre Not ‚ÄúToo Much‚Äù or ‚ÄúNot Enough‚Äù

Max also realized that his feelings of gloom were not just about climbing trees but tied to a deeper sense of [ADHD carrying school shame](/pages/adhd-carrying-school-shame/), which he'd been shouldering since kittenhood.

Max pondered this as he sat on his favorite branch. "Maybe I shouldn't climb trees," he thought, frowning. This is what we call ADHD internalized ableism, where Max started to doubt his abilities just because they were different from others.

But then, he remembered the wise words of Mrs. Whiskers, the oldest cat in the neighborhood. "Max," she had said, "your way of climbing trees is special. It's not wrong; it's just yours."

With a twitch of his tail, Max looked around. He saw all the wonderful things he discovered on his unique climbs‚Äîhidden nests, secret branches, and the best leafy nooks that other cats never noticed.

Max decided then and there that his tree-climbing adventures weren't wrong; they were extraordinary! Each scramble up the bark and each playful chase of a leaf was a part of who he was. He wouldn't let those whispers make him doubt his tree-climbing skills anymore.

With a renewed purr of confidence, Max leapt from his branch, ready to explore the tree in his own, unmatched way. "Here's to climbing trees my way!" he meowed joyously, as a butterfly landed softly on his nose, reminding him of the beauty in his unique path.

As the garden party drew to a close, Ellie realized she had learned a valuable lesson about ADHD internalized ableism. She understood that the real magic wasn't in having a "normal" garden but in appreciating the unique beauty of her wild, colorful flowers.

## Embracing Neurodiversity: ADHD Minds Are Wildflowers, Not Weeds

Ellie's journey also reminded her how she once felt burdened by labels from childhood, a sentiment echoed in the stories of others who had been similarly [tagged as disruptive](/pages/adhd-labeled-as-disruptive/).

Ellie shared her newfound wisdom with her friends, explaining how each person's mind garden is special. "Just like my garden, our brains have their own way of blooming," she said with a smile.

Her friends nodded, seeing their unique qualities as strengths rather than flaws. They left the party feeling lighter and more accepting of themselves.

Ellie watched them go, her heart as full as her vibrant garden. She whispered to her flowers, "We're perfect just as we are."

And the garden, in its own chaotic, beautiful way, whispered back, "Yes, we are."
