Imagine your brain is like a super-busy bee, buzzing from flower to flower. Now, it's showtime at school, and all eyes are on you. Feels like standing in a spotlight with nowhere to hide, right?

You want to share your thoughts, but uh-oh, words jumble up like a deck of cards tossed in the air. Everyone seems to get their cards in order, but yours? They're still floating around, trying to land.

But here's the secret: every bee finds its way back to the hive, and so will you. Next time you feel on display, remember, it's okay to fly at your own pace.

Hey, why not share your colorful, jumbled cards next time? There might just be a surprise in the chaos waiting to be seen.

Once upon a time, in the bustling village of Mindful Meadows, there lived a bright, bouncy squirrel named Simon. Simon had ADHD, and he was *terrified* of being seen. Not just peek-a-boo seen, but really *seen*—like his zippy thoughts and whirlwind actions being on full display.

One sunny afternoon, Simon decided to venture to the village square. The idea alone made his heart race faster than a cheetah on roller skates! He was worried. What if everyone noticed how he couldn’t sit still? Or how he'd leap from one topic to another like a frog in a lily pad race?

### Why ADHD Can Make You Afraid of Being Seen

As Simon scurried along, his mind was a carousel of worries, spinning round and round. “What if they laugh?" he fretted, twitching his bushy tail nervously.

He paused by a mirror-like pond, watching his reflection. “Maybe if I just blend in…” Simon thought, nibbling on a nut, his tiny hands fidgety.

When we last saw our hero, Zippy, she was hiding behind a tall stack of rainbow-colored books in the library. The big scary dragon of fear was looming, making her feel small and unnoticed. "ADHD afraid of being seen," she whispered to herself, almost like a magic spell that could keep her invisible.

Zippy peeped through a gap between the books. The library was a safe haven, filled with stories and secrets, much like her own mind. Sometimes, she felt like a knight, ready to battle dragons. Other times, she just wanted to be a quiet mouse, unnoticed and unbothered.

Feeling small and unnoticed often made her wrestle with a sense of [ADHD low self-worth](/pages/adhd-low-self-worth/), yet here, amid the books, she could dream of being mighty.

### Hiding and Masking: How ADHD Kids Cope with Social Fear

As she sat there, her friend Buzz the bumblebee buzzed by, startling her. "Zippy! What are you doing behind those books?" he asked, his little wings flapping a gentle breeze.

"I'm hiding," she admitted, her voice as soft as a feather.

"Why hide when you can fly?" Buzz encouraged. "Let's go on an adventure! Show the world the colors of your wings."

Zippy thought for a moment. Each page in her hideout told a story of courage and adventure. Maybe, just maybe, she could be the hero in her own story, even if that meant being seen.

Hand in hand, or hand in wing, they zipped out from behind the books, ready to face the big, beautiful world together.

In the cozy corners of the library, Ivy and her new friend nestled among piles of books. They chatted about everything and nothing, especially about being afraid of being seen with ADHD. But as they shared, their fears seemed to shrink, like sweaters in the wash.

"They're just thoughts," Ivy said, smiling. "And thoughts can change."

Amid their heartfelt exchanges, Ivy confessed how she had long battled with the feeling of [never being good enough](/pages/adhd-never-good-enough/), a sentiment her friend understood all too well.

"Like magic!" her friend giggled. They made a pact to support each other, no matter what.

### Building Confidence with ADHD Through Friendship

Day by day, Ivy felt lighter. She was learning to dance with her thoughts, not fight them. Her friend was her cheerleader, always ready with a kind word or a silly joke.

In the end, Ivy realized that being seen wasn't so scary. It was just another adventure, waiting with open arms. With friends by her side and a smile in her heart, she was ready to face the world.

"Let's go explore," she whispered. And so, they did.
