Imagine you're a superhero, but instead of flying, you speed-skate on ice. Super-fast, super fun! But sometimes, oops! You forget where you put your skates.

So, you put on seven layers of socks, just in case you find seven different skates. You might look funny, wobbling around, but you're ready for anything!

Hey, why not join the fun? Let's find our skates together, and maybe share a sock or two!

Milly had a superpower, sort of like having turbocharged roller skates for her brain. She zipped and zoomed from one thought to another. Sometimes, though, she zoomed too fast, especially when she felt she wasn't doing enough. That's when her ADHD overcompensating kicked in, like a superhero who doesn't know her own strength.

On a bright Saturday morning, Milly decided she was going to be the best plant mom ever. Her little apartment jungle was going to be pristine! She started with the fern in the corner, then zipped to the succulents on the windowsill, and suddenly, whoosh! Now she was repotting the cactus that definitely didn't need repotting.

### The Great Plant Explosion

In a whirlwind of soil and leaves, Milly's living room looked like a salad after a food fight. She plopped into a pile of potting soil, panting. "Maybe that was too much," she sighed, looking at her dirt-streaked cat who seemed to agree. But hey, at least the plants were watered, twice... or was it three times?

Milly's day had just begun. She had a list! Well, several lists. And each list had its own color-coded sub-list. She was determined to tick off every box by lunchtime.

When we last left Sam, the squirrel, he was in a whirlwind of activity, trying to gather every acorn in sight. His little paws were a blur, racing from tree to tree. This, my friends, is a bit like when someone with ADHD overcompensates.

### Acorn Avalanche!

This gentle approach allowed Sam to focus better without the constant fear of acorns—and expectations—crashing down around him, a feeling all too familiar to those grappling with [ADHD and the fear of being found out](/pages/adhd-fear-of-being-found-out/).

Sam wanted to prove he could gather acorns just as well as anyone. Maybe even better! So he piled them high, creating mountains of acorns. But oh, the mess! Acorns toppled and rolled every which way. Sam scurried to catch them, but there were just too many.

It got a bit overwhelming. Just like when someone tries too hard to manage ADHD, and things start slipping through the cracks. Sam paused, his tiny chest heaving. He realized maybe he didn’t need to prove anything. Maybe he just needed to gather what he could handle.

And so, Sam decided to slow down. He chose one tree, just one, and started there. No more racing. No more toppling mountains of acorns. Just one little squirrel and his chosen tree, gathering at his own pace.

As the afternoon sun dipped below the horizon, Jamie finally understood the dance of ADHD overcompensating. It was like a boomerang—sent out with extra energy, always spinning back with a few surprises.

Jamie decided to embrace the boomerang. Maybe it didn't always fly straight, but it sure made life interesting! They promised themselves to appreciate the zany detours instead of stressing about the perfect path.

Amidst their reflections, Jamie realized this pattern also fed into a deeper issue, often feeling like they were [ADHD masking at work](/pages/adhd-masking-at-work/), always performing to meet others’ expectations while hiding their true self.

### Boomerang Bonanza!

At the family dinner, Jamie shared their new perspective. "Think of my brain like a playful puppy," Jamie explained, "it runs around excitedly, but always comes back with something unexpected!"

Everyone chuckled, picturing a puppy scampering joyously around the yard.

From then on, Jamie tackled tasks with a smile, knowing each day might be a bit wobbly but wondrous in its own way. They learned to harness their boomerang energy creatively, turning unexpected returns into opportunities.

In the cozy glow of their bedroom, scribbling in a journal, Jamie felt a warm satisfaction. ADHD wasn't a flaw but a feature—an extra splash of color in their life's painting.

So, let's throw our boomerangs with gusto, embracing the unpredictable flights, and celebrate where they land!
