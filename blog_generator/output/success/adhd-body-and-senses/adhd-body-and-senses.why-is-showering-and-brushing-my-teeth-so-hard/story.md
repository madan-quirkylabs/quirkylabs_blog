### **ðŸš¿ Why Your ADHD Brain Blue-Screens Before the Shower (And the 60-Second Reboot)**

ðŸŽ¨ *Visual Hook: Include a DALLÂ·E prompt for a title image: 'Frustrated cartoon character staring at a bathroom mirror, surrounded by floating app icons and undone hygiene tasks, pop-art style.'"*

ðŸ“– **RELATABLE OPENING â€” "Take One"**

Me: "I'll just check one work email before hopping in the shower."
Also me, three hours later: "How did I end up watching a documentary about the mating rituals of deep-sea jellyfish?"
ðŸ˜‚ *Cartoon Prompt: MidJourney: â€˜Overwhelmed office worker in pajamas, surrounded by glowing phone, bathroom mirror reflecting a neglected toothbrush.â€™"*

Ugh, the shower. It looms. Not like a fun, spa-day shower. More like a boss level in a video game I'm perpetually losing. I know I *should*. My hair is starting to resemble a science experiment, and I'm pretty sure my coworkers are giving me the side-eye. I even bought that fancy shampoo with the aromatherapy. It's sitting there, mocking me.

"It's just a shower, Alex," I mutter to myself, scrolling through TikTok (for *work*, obviously â€“ researching social media trends). "Everyone showers. It's basic human stuff."

A wave of shame washes over me. *Why can't I just do this?* I brush it aside. I'm a high-achieving professional! I manage complex projects, I lead teams, I... I can't seem to make myself step into a box with running water.

My brain offers a justification: "I need to find the perfect playlist first. The *perfect* temperature. The *perfect* towel placement. Preparation is key! It's all about optimizing the experience for maximum efficiency... which will, in turn, boost productivity!"

Another hour vanishes. I'm now researching the history of shower curtains. The video call is in 30 minutes. My hair still looks like a bird's nest. Iâ€™m so productive.

### ðŸ”„ NARRATIVE REPLAY â€” "Take Two"

Okay, new plan. "Good enough," I whisper, feeling slightly less defeated. I set a timer for 90 seconds. CEO Shower, here I come.

I step into the shower. The water is freezing. I almost bolt. Then I remember the "sensory override." I focus on the smell of the lemon soap. It's... vaguely pleasant.

I manage to rinse, lather my left arm, and rinse again before the timer goes off. Victory? Sort of. My hair is still a disaster. But I smell like lemons, and I didn't spend three hours researching shower curtains.

I grab my phone, ready for my 5 minutes of guilt-free scrolling. Except... I accidentally open my email. A notification pops up: "Urgent project update!"

My brain screams. I close my email. I close all my apps. I stare at the wall for five minutes. It's not scrolling, but it's also not work.

I didnâ€™t get the hack perfectâ€¦ but the second try still worked.
