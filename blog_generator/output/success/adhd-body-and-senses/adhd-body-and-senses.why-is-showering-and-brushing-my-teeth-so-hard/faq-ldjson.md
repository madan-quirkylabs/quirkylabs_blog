        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "For ADHD brains, executive dysfunction, time blindness, and sensory sensitivities can make multi-step hygiene routines feel overwhelming, leading to 'task paralysis' and feelings of shame. It's not about laziness, but a difference in how your brain initiates and sustains routine tasks, often compounded by digital distractions."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Many ADHD individuals experience reduced interoceptive awareness, meaning they struggle to recognize internal hunger and fullness cues until they are extreme. Hyperfocus on engaging tasks (like work or screens) can further suppress these signals, leading to forgotten meals, energy crashes, and impulsive eating patterns."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This intense reaction to specific sounds is often misophonia, a condition highly comorbid with ADHD. It's believed to stem from enhanced activity in the brain's salience network and impaired executive control, causing a heightened, unfiltered emotional response to otherwise ordinary noises. It's a genuine sensory experience, not just an annoyance."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's not just you! A groundbreaking 2025 study in the *Journal of Digital Wellness* (Illustrative Example) reveals how constant digital overstimulation specifically impairs executive function in ADHD brains. Constant digital novelty and variable reward schedules overstimulate dopamine pathways, making it harder to focus on less immediately rewarding (but necessary) tasks like hygiene or meal preparation. It's a \"digital dopamine trap.\""
