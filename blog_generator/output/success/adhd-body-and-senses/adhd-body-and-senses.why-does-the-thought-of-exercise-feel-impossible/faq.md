### **Comprehensive FAQ: ADHD Body & Senses: Conquering Exercise Dread**

#### **Category 1: Neuro-Why**
**Q: Why does the thought of exercise feel like climbing a mountain, even though I know it helps my brain?**
**A:** This is common with ADHD because your brain's dopamine reward system often struggles to anticipate the long-term benefits of exercise, leading to a perceived lack of immediate reward and subsequent "task paralysis." Volkow et al. (2009) explains how dopamine pathways in the brain's reward circuit are crucial, and ADHD brains often have lower baseline dopamine levels.

**Q: How is this different from just being unmotivated?**
**A:** It’s not just a lack of motivation; it's a neurobiological barrier. Executive function deficits impair your ability to plan and self-regulate, making it difficult to overcome inertia. Pluess et al. (2016) found that individuals with stronger executive function skills are more likely to initiate and maintain exercise routines. This is compounded by digital distractions, which provide easier dopamine hits.

#### **Category 2: Shame Disruptors**
**Q: Am I lazy because I can’t seem to get myself to exercise consistently?**
**A:** This isn’t laziness—it’s neurobiology. Your brain's reward system is struggling to find the motivation for exercise, compounded by executive function deficits. Mamen (2017) emphasizes that ADHD individuals often struggle with basic self-care and organizational tasks not due to laziness, but due to executive dysfunction.

**Q: Does everyone with ADHD struggle with exercise?**
**A:** It's a common struggle. Kittel et al. (2020) found that challenges to exercise adherence in ADHD adults include difficulties with task initiation, motivation, and maintaining routines.

#### **Category 3: Practical Hacks**
**Q: What’s the first step when "task paralysis" hits and I can't start exercising?**
**A:** Use the QuirkyLabs "2-Minute Movement Burst":
1. Choose a super short activity (e.g., dance to one song).
2. Set a timer for 2 minutes.
3. Reward yourself afterward with a small, non-exercise related treat.

**Q: How do I exercise when I’m in ‘Spoonie Mode’?**
**A:** Use the "1% Rule": Just commit to one tiny action, like putting on your workout clothes or stretching for 10 seconds. This can help break the inertia.

#### **Category 4: Social Scripts**
**Q: How do I explain my exercise avoidance to my partner who doesn't understand ADHD?**
**A:** AI-generated script: *"[Partner], my ADHD brain struggles with initiating exercise because of dopamine differences. It’s not laziness. Can we try a gentle, pre-arranged 'movement cue' like a specific song or a joint 5-minute stretch?"*

#### **Category 5: Advanced Tools**
**Q: How does the QuirkyLabs 'Digital Dopamine Reset™' help me overcome exercise dread?**
**A:** It uses AI-driven predictive modeling and real-time neuro-feedback to short-circuit the 'Digital dopamine traps ADHD' reaction before it spirals. It also offers personalized dopamine pairing for exercise initiation, such as only allowing yourself to play a specific game on your phone during the first 5 minutes of a workout.
