        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's likely your \"Motivation Meter\" is running on empty! For ADHD brains, exercise can be a triple threat: low dopamine, executive function challenges, and sensory sensitivities. Your brain may perceive exercise as effortful and lacking immediate reward, leading to that \"couch-lock\" feeling. It's not laziness; it's neurobiology."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "ADHD brains often struggle with initiating tasks, especially those that don't offer instant gratification. Your dopamine reward system might not be firing up at the *thought* of exercise, and your executive functions (planning, organization) might be overwhelmed by the steps involved."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Absolutely. Technology is designed to be highly rewarding and stimulating. The constant notifications and endless scroll of social media provide easy dopamine hits, making it even harder to choose exercise, which requires effort and delayed gratification. These \"digital dopamine traps\" can hijack your brain's reward system."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes! Many ADHD individuals experience sensory sensitivities. The loud gym, uncomfortable workout clothes, or even the feeling of sweat can be overwhelming and create a strong aversion to exercise."

        "text": "Initiate a 3-second \"Dopamine Priming Protocol\" by recalling a past small win or engaging in a brief, enjoyable micro-task (e.g., stretching for 10 seconds). Then, try a \"2-Minute Movement Burst,\" like dancing to one favorite song. The key is *low effort* and *immediate dopamine*."

For example: \"Honey, my ADHD brain sometimes struggles with the 'start' button for exercise due to dopamine differences. It’s not about being lazy; it’s a specific neural circuit. A gentle, pre-arranged 'movement cue' (e.g., a specific song or a joint 5-minute stretch) helps me kickstart.\""

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Acknowledge that your brain is wired differently. Difficulty initiating exercise in ADHD is often due to dopamine dysregulation and executive function deficits. It's not laziness; it's a genuine neural roadblock. Focus on small wins and celebrate progress, not perfection."
