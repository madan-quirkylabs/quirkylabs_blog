      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This is common with ADHD because your brain's dopamine reward system often struggles to anticipate the long-term benefits of exercise, leading to a perceived lack of immediate reward and subsequent \"task paralysis.\" Volkow et al. (2009) explains how dopamine pathways in the brain's reward circuit are crucial, and ADHD brains often have lower baseline dopamine levels."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It’s not just a lack of motivation; it's a neurobiological barrier. Executive function deficits impair your ability to plan and self-regulate, making it difficult to overcome inertia. Pluess et al. (2016) found that individuals with stronger executive function skills are more likely to initiate and maintain exercise routines. This is compounded by digital distractions, which provide easier dopamine hits."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This isn’t laziness—it’s neurobiology. Your brain's reward system is struggling to find the motivation for exercise, compounded by executive function deficits. Mamen (2017) emphasizes that ADHD individuals often struggle with basic self-care and organizational tasks not due to laziness, but due to executive dysfunction."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It uses AI-driven predictive modeling and real-time neuro-feedback to short-circuit the 'Digital dopamine traps ADHD' reaction before it spirals. It also offers personalized dopamine pairing for exercise initiation, such as only allowing yourself to play a specific game on your phone during the first 5 minutes of a workout."
