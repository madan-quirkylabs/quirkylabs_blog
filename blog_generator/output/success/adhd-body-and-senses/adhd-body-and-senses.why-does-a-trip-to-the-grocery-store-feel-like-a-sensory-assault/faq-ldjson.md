        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "For ADHD brains, executive dysfunction, time blindness, and sensory sensitivities can make multi-step hygiene routines feel overwhelming, leading to \"task paralysis\" and feelings of shame. It's not about laziness, but a difference in how your brain initiates and sustains routine tasks, often compounded by digital distractions."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Many ADHD individuals experience reduced interoceptive awareness, meaning they struggle to recognize internal hunger and fullness cues until they are extreme. Hyperfocus on engaging tasks (like work or screens) can further suppress these signals, leading to forgotten meals, energy crashes, and impulsive eating patterns."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This intense reaction to specific sounds is often misophonia, a condition highly comorbid with ADHD. It's believed to stem from enhanced activity in the brain's salience network and impaired executive control, causing a heightened, unfiltered emotional response to otherwise ordinary noises. It's a genuine sensory experience, not just an annoyance."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Because your brain's sensory filtering mechanisms are often atypical in ADHD, leading to sensory overload in environments like grocery stores. It's not about being weak; it's a genuine neurological hurdle where too much input overwhelms your system. Our Neuro-AI identifies your specific neural roadblock and offers a personalized bypass."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Try this 15-minute method:\n    1. **Validate Your Brain & Identify Digital Triggers:** Understand that hygiene difficulties and digital overwhelm are neurobiological. Identify your \"digital dopamine traps\" (e.g., social media, notifications).\n    2. **Implement the 'Good Enough' Micro-Reset:** Break down hygiene into tiny, achievable 2-minute \"micro-tasks\" (e.g., just wash your face, brush teeth for 30 seconds). Immediately follow with a 5-minute \"digital detox\" break.\n    3. **Gamify Your Next Micro-Win & Track Progress:** Reward yourself with a small, non-digital dopamine hit after completing a hygiene micro-task (e.g., listening to one song). Use game-based tools to track your \"micro-wins,\" building momentum without perfectionism."
