        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "When an ADHD brain enters a sensory-rich environment, the impaired filtering mechanisms in the prefrontal cortex and differences in sensory gating in the thalamus allow a constant influx of overwhelming stimuli (Bijlenga et al., 2017). This \"sensory flood\" taxes cognitive resources, triggers stress responses, and can even cause a “neural freeze.”"

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's not simply annoyance; it's a genuine neurobiological challenge. Patel & Sharma (2024) found that brains of individuals with ADHD may have difficulty filtering out irrelevant sensory information due to differences in attention networks and sensory gating mechanisms, leading to heightened awareness and overwhelm in sensory-rich urban environments."

        "text": "This isn't about being dramatic; it's how your brain is wired. This is a <b>neurobiological barrier</b>, not a moral failing. Your [brain_region] is overloaded by [trigger]. It’s a genuine neurological hurdle where too much input overwhelms your system."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "While not everyone experiences it to the same degree, sensory processing difficulties are highly prevalent in adults with ADHD. Bijlenga et al. (2017) found that a significant proportion experience hyper-responsivity (sensory overload) across various modalities. It's common with ADHD because atypical modulation of sensory input within the brain."
