### **ðŸŽ¯ Why Your ADHD Brain Forgets to Eat (And the 'Fuel Up!' Hack That Works)**

ðŸŽ¨ *Visual Hook: DALLÂ·E prompt: "Cartoon character with ADHD, eyes glued to a computer screen filled with code, a half-eaten sandwich rotting beside them, pop-art style."*

ðŸ“– **RELATABLE OPENING â€” "Take One"**

Me: "I'll just answer this *one* email before lunch."
Also me, five hours later: "Why is the room spinning? And is that...rage I feel?"
ðŸŽ¨ *Cartoon Prompt: MidJourney: "Overwhelmed office worker with 57 browser tabs, one labeled â€˜Urgent Client Thingâ„¢â€™ with a giant red arrow, and a thought bubble saying 'But what if I just finish *this* one thing?'"*

Right, lunch. That thing people do to, you know, *live*. I was supposed to eat it sometime around noon. Now it'sâ€¦well, let's just say the sun is thinking about setting.

I mean, it's not *my* fault. This client thing was *urgent*. And besides, I was in the zone! Flow state, baby! I was practically a productivity ninja. Okay, a productivity ninja who's now seeing little cartoon birdies circling my head, but still.

And anyway, I'll just grab something quick. That leftover pizza in the fridge is practically begging to be eaten. Never mind that I had pizza last night. It's fuel! Brain fuel!

A tiny voice whispers, "Maybe a salad would be a better choice?" I quickly ignore it. Salad is forâ€¦ tomorrow-me. Tomorrow-me is very health-conscious. Today-me just needs to not pass out before this client call.

A wave of guilt washes over me. I should be better at this. More organized. Moreâ€¦normal. I shove the guilt down with a large slice of cold pizza. Problem solved! (For approximately 10 minutes.)

ðŸŽ® **SOLUTION QUEST**

- **Step 1: Whisper â€˜Fuel Up.â€™ +5 XP.** Acknowledge that your brain is wired differently. No shame, just science.
- **ðŸ“» Podcast Script Note:** *"Sound effect: â€˜Level upâ€™ chime after each step."*
- **Step 2: The Visible Snack Hack. +10 XP.** Place a protein bar or nuts where you *can't* miss them. Like, taped to your monitor miss them.
- **ðŸ˜‚ Meme Callout:** *"Before/After: â€˜Healthy Meal Prepâ€™ (mountain of Tupperware) vs. â€˜Protein Bar on Deskâ€™ (single, glorious bar)."*
- **Step 3: Micro-Alarm Magic. +15 XP.** Set an alarm for every 2-3 hours. Label it "Fuel Up!" not "Lunch." Less pressure, more action.
- **Step 4: Dopamine Pair. +20 XP.** Only allow yourself to listen to your favorite song *while* you're eating. Train your brain to associate food with fun.

ðŸ”„ **NARRATIVE REPLAY â€” "Take Two"**

Okay, new plan. "Fuel Up!" alarm just went off. I see the protein bar taped to my monitor. It's staring at me. Mocking me, maybe.

I almost ignore it. Almost dive back into that spreadsheet. But then I remember: Fuel Up! It's not a chore, it's a quest.

I grab the protein bar. It tastesâ€¦okay. Not pizza, but not terrible. I put on my favorite song. Suddenly, eating a protein bar isn't the worst thing in the world.

I only manage to eat half the bar before my brain starts wandering back to work. I resist. I close the laptop. I stare out the window for 30 seconds.

Then, I open the laptop. Baby steps. At least I ate *something*.

ðŸŽ¨ *Cartoon Prompt: DALLÂ·E: "Cartoon character high-fiving themselves after eating half a protein bar, confetti explosion, laptop slightly ajar in the background."*
