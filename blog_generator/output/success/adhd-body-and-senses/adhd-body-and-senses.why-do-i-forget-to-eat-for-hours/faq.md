### **Comprehensive FAQ: ADHD Body & Senses: Nutrition, Hygiene, and Sensory Overload**

#### **Category 1: Neuro-Why**
**Q: Why does forgetting to eat feel like a sudden energy crash instead of a normal hunger pang?**
**A:** When you're hyperfocused, your prefrontal cortex suppresses interoceptive awareness, making it difficult to perceive internal bodily signals like hunger (Zickgraf et al., 2020). This is compounded by digital distractions that overstimulate dopamine pathways, overriding hunger signals (Volkow et al., 2009). It's like your brain's "fuel gauge" is broken.

**Q: How is forgetting to eat with ADHD different from just being busy?**
**A:** It's not just about being busy; it's a neurobiological difference. Adults with ADHD exhibit significantly lower interoceptive awareness, making it harder to perceive hunger cues (Zickgraf et al., 2020). Semrud-Clikeman (2012) found prefrontal-amygdala dysregulation in this context.

#### **Category 2: Shame Disruptors**
**Q: Am I lazy because I can't remember to eat, even when I know I need to?**
**A:** This isn’t laziness—it’s a neurobiological barrier. Your insula, the brain region responsible for interoception, is under-activated due to hyperfocus and digital stimulation, making it hard to recognize hunger signals (Zickgraf et al., 2020). It's like trying to drive a car with a broken fuel gauge.

**Q: Does everyone with ADHD struggle with forgetting to eat?**
**A:** Yes, it's a common struggle! Many ADHD individuals experience reduced interoceptive awareness, leading to irregular eating patterns (Zickgraf et al., 2020). The high comorbidity of ADHD and eating disorders also points to this (Nazar et al., 2019).

#### **Category 3: Practical Hacks**
**Q: What’s the first step when I realize I've forgotten to eat for hours and feel an energy crash coming on?**
**A:** Use the QuirkyLabs 'Good Enough' Nutrition Protocol:
1. **Micro-action:** Grab a readily available, 'safe' snack like a protein bar or handful of nuts.
2. **Dopamine-paired reward:** Allow yourself 5 minutes of guilt-free scrolling or listening to a favorite song while eating.
3. **Sensory cue:** Gently tap your sternum to prime your interoceptive networks for better hunger signal reception.

**Q: How do I prepare meals when I’m in ‘Spoonie Mode’ and have task paralysis?**
**A:** Embrace the 1% Rule: Just do *one tiny thing* to move towards meal prep.
1. Set out a plate.
2. Open a can of soup.
3. Put a protein bar next to your keyboard.
Mamen (2017) emphasizes practical, low-barrier strategies for self-care.

#### **Category 4: Social Scripts**
**Q: How do I explain my forgotten meals to my partner without feeling judged?**
**A:** *"[Partner], my ADHD brain sometimes misses internal hunger signals, especially when I'm hyperfocused. It’s not about ignoring you or food; it's an interoception thing. A gentle, pre-arranged 'food alert signal' (e.g., a specific emoji or a visible snack) helps me re-tune."*

#### **Category 5: Advanced Tools**
**Q: How does the QuirkyLabs 'Digital Dopamine Reset' help me remember to eat?**
**A:** It uses personalized sensory cues and AI-driven narrative re-framing to interrupt the shame spiral and re-contextualize the forgotten meal trigger before it leads to a binge. It also helps you identify and manage your digital dopamine traps. It uses neuro-strategy to bypass brain region blockage. Example: *Reply Roulette gamifies texting to reduce amygdala activation.*
