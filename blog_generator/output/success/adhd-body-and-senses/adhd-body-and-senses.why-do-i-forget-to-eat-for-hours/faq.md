### **Comprehensive FAQ: Is Your ADHD Brain Hijacked by Digital Dopamine Traps? A Deep Dive into Body, Senses & Tech Overwhelm**

#### **Neuro-Why**

**Q: Why does forgetting to eat feel like a "neural freeze," leaving me unable to perform basic tasks?**
**A:** When you're hyperfocused, your prefrontal cortex suppresses interoceptive awareness, diverting dopamine away from hunger signals (Zickgraf et al., 2020). This is compounded by "digital dopamine traps," making it hard to prioritize meals. This is your brain's way of prioritizing immediate rewards over long-term needs.

**Q: How is this different from just being forgetful or having a busy day?**
**A:** It's not just forgetfulness; it's a neurobiological difference. ADHD brains have difficulty filtering out irrelevant sensory information and regulating dopamine, leading to heightened awareness and overwhelm in sensory-rich urban environments (Patel & Sharma, 2024). This results in a diminished ability to accurately perceive and interpret internal bodily signals, impacting self-regulation of basic physiological needs (Zickgraf et al., 2020).

#### **Shame Disruptors**

**Q: Am I lazy or unprofessional because I forget to eat during work?**
**A:** This isn’t laziness—it’s a neurobiological barrier. The prefrontal cortex suppresses interoceptive awareness signals from the insula and anterior cingulate cortex, diverting dopamine pathways away from basic physiological needs and towards the engaging activity (Zickgraf et al., 2020). Try our 'Hyperfocus Meal Prep Micro-Burst' to rewire this.

**Q: Does everyone with ADHD struggle with this, or is it just me?**
**A:** This is common with ADHD because many ADHD individuals experience reduced interoceptive awareness (Zickgraf et al., 2020). This impairment can contribute to irregular eating patterns, forgetting to eat, or emotional eating due to a disconnect from physiological hunger and satiety cues. You're not alone in this struggle.

#### **Practical Hacks**

**Q: What’s the first step when I realize I haven’t eaten for hours and feel dizzy?**
**A:** Initiate a 3-second 'Neural Nourishment Reset' by gently tapping your sternum. This primes your interoceptive networks for optimal hunger signal reception. Follow it up with the 'Visible Snack & Micro-Alarm' (keep a protein bar next to your keyboard and set a 30-minute smart alarm with a gentle haptic buzz).

**Q: How do I prepare meals when I’m in ‘Spoonie Mode’ and have no energy?**
**A:** Use the 'Hyperfocus Meal Prep Micro-Burst': an AI-curated 5-minute meal prep checklist + custom-generated 'eat now' sound prompt paired with a preferred song snippet. Mamen (2017) emphasizes practical, low-barrier, 'good enough' strategies.

#### **Social Scripts**

**Q: How do I explain my forgotten meals to my partner without them thinking I’m irresponsible?**
**A:** AI-generated script: *"Honey, my ADHD brain sometimes misses internal hunger signals, especially when I'm hyperfocused. It’s not about ignoring you or food; it's an interoception thing. A gentle, pre-arranged 'food alert signal' (e.g., a specific emoji or a visible snack) helps me re-tune."*

#### **Advanced Tools**

**Q: How does the 'Adaptive App Firewall for Hyperfocus' short-circuit my forgotten meals?**
**A:** It locks distracting apps during scheduled meal times and 'focus blocks', learning user's hyperfocus patterns. This helps prevent digital distractions from overriding hunger signals, ensuring you take breaks to eat (Owens & Marks, 2025).
