      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Many ADHD individuals experience reduced interoceptive awareness, meaning they struggle to recognize internal hunger and fullness cues until they are extreme. Hyperfocus on engaging tasks (like work or screens) can further suppress these signals, leading to forgotten meals, energy crashes, and impulsive eating patterns. It's not a lack of willpower, but a neurobiological difference."

    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Is it really an ADHD thing that I can't tell when I'm hungry until I'm dizzy or irritable?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes! Reduced interoceptive awareness is common in ADHD. Your brain has trouble accurately sensing and interpreting internal bodily signals like hunger. This is compounded by hyperfocus, where your attention is so intensely focused that it drowns out those subtle hunger cues."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Why does it feel impossible to stop what I'm doing to eat, even when I know I need to?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This is often due to a combination of factors. First, executive dysfunction makes it hard to switch tasks, even basic ones like eating. Second, the dopamine rush from your current activity (especially if it involves screens) can override the lower-dopamine \"reward\" of eating a meal. Your brain prioritizes the immediate stimulation."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "I feel so much shame admitting it, but I have a horrible habit that is getting overwhelming and out of hand. Why does this happen?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Many people with ADHD experience shame related to self-care challenges like nutrition. It's often a result of repeated criticism or feeling like you \"should\" be able to manage things easily. Remember, your brain is wired differently, and these challenges are neurobiological, not personal failings."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What's the first step to take if I constantly forget to eat during hyperfocus?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Start with *external* reminders. Don't rely on internal hunger cues. Set alarms on your phone (and make them *annoying*!), use visual cues like sticky notes, or ask a friend to check in with you. The goal is to create a system that bypasses your reduced interoceptive awareness."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What if I set alarms, but I just ignore them and keep working?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This is where *dopamine pairing* comes in. Link eating with something you genuinely enjoy. For example, only allow yourself to listen to your favorite podcast episode while you're eating. This creates a positive association and makes it more likely you'll interrupt your work."

      "name": "What are some \"good enough\" meal/snack options for when I'm short on time and energy?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Aim for quick, protein-rich options that require minimal effort. Think protein bars, Greek yogurt, hard-boiled eggs, nuts, or pre-cut veggies with hummus. The goal is to fuel your brain without adding to the overwhelm."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Don't force yourself to eat things you dislike. Focus on finding healthy options that you actually *enjoy*. Experiment with different flavors, textures, and cuisines. If you crave crunchy, try roasted chickpeas. If you want sweet, add berries to your yogurt."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Be direct and explain the neurobiological reasons behind your struggles. Try saying something like, \"My ADHD brain has trouble sensing hunger cues, especially when I'm focused. It would be really helpful if you could gently remind me to eat around lunchtime.\""

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Plan ahead and pack healthy snacks. Keep them visible and easily accessible at your desk. If possible, schedule short breaks for eating and communicate your needs to your boss. You might say, \"I've found that taking short, regular breaks to eat helps me maintain focus and productivity throughout the day.\""

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Create a \"safe space\" for your food. Keep your healthy snacks in a separate container or drawer. When you're tempted by junk food, remind yourself of your goals and reach for your pre-planned snack."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Forgive yourself. Binging happens. It's not a moral failing. Focus on getting back on track with your healthy eating plan at your next meal. Avoid dwelling on the slip-up."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Remember that your health is your priority. You don't need to justify your food choices to anyone. If you're feeling self-conscious, focus on your own goals and remind yourself that you're doing what's best for *your* brain and body."
