      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "When a trigger sound (like chewing) is perceived, it can activate a hyper-reactive amygdala response, bypassing typical sensory filtering. This leads to intense emotional reactions and physiological responses before you can even consciously process it. (Jager et al., 2020). This is often exacerbated in ADHD due to shared traits like emotional dysregulation and sensory hypersensitivity."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's definitely an ADHD thing, and often misophonia! Bijlenga et al. (2017) found that sensory processing difficulties are highly prevalent in adults with ADHD. Your brain may have difficulty filtering out irrelevant sensory information, leading to overwhelm. This is a genuine neurological experience, not just an annoyance."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Absolutely not! This isn't a moral failing—it's a neurobiological reality. Your amygdala is likely overreacting to these sounds (Jager et al., 2020). It's not about being \"overly sensitive\"; it's that certain sounds trigger intense emotional and physiological responses."

      "name": "Does everyone with ADHD struggle with sensory overload and misophonia?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "While not everyone with ADHD experiences it, sensory processing difficulties and misophonia are very common. Studies show a significant comorbidity between misophonia and ADHD (Siepsiak et al., 2021). This is common with ADHD because ADHD brains can have difficulty filtering out irrelevant sensory stimuli."

It’s not your fault or about me being angry at you; it’s my brain's wiring. A gentle, pre-arranged 'sensory signal' (e.g., a specific hand gesture or emoji) helps me manage in the moment.\""
