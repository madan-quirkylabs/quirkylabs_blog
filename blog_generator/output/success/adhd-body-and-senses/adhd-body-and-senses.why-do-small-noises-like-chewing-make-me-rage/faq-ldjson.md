      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "For ADHD brains, executive dysfunction, time blindness, and sensory sensitivities can make multi-step hygiene routines feel overwhelming, leading to \"task paralysis\" and feelings of shame. It's not about laziness, but a difference in how your brain initiates and sustains routine tasks, often compounded by digital distractions."

      "name": "Why do I forget to eat for hours when I have ADHD?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Many ADHD individuals experience reduced interoceptive awareness, meaning they struggle to recognize internal hunger and fullness cues until they are extreme. Hyperfocus on engaging tasks (like work or screens) can further suppress these signals, leading to forgotten meals, energy crashes, and impulsive eating patterns."

      "name": "Why do small noises like chewing make me rage if I have ADHD?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This intense reaction to specific sounds is often misophonia, a condition highly comorbid with ADHD. It's believed to stem from enhanced activity in the brain's salience network and impaired executive control, causing a heightened, unfiltered emotional response to otherwise ordinary noises. It's a genuine sensory experience, not just an annoyance."

      "name": "Is my \"phone addiction\" a moral failing, or is something else going on with my ADHD brain?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's not a moral failing! Your ADHD brain is wired differently, and modern technology is designed to exploit that. Constant digital novelty and variable reward schedules overstimulate dopamine pathways, making it harder for the prefrontal cortex to override immediate gratification and direct attention towards less immediately rewarding tasks like hygiene or meal preparation."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "While research is ongoing, women with ADHD are more likely to experience certain hypersensitivity types (tactile defensiveness, sensory overload). Hormonal fluctuations can also impact symptom severity, affecting self-care and sensory management."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Break down hygiene into tiny, achievable 2-minute \"micro-tasks\" (e.g., just wash your face, brush teeth for 30 seconds). Immediately follow with a 5-minute \"digital detox\" break - put your phone in another room. Reward yourself with a small, non-digital dopamine hit after completing a hygiene micro-task (e.g., listening to one song)."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Set tailored smart alarms to remind you to eat. Keep visible snacks nearby. Be mindful of interoceptive cues. Mindful eating practices can help you reconnect with your body's hunger and fullness signals."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Schedule strategic digital \"fasts\" and mindful tech use. Identify digital triggers. Build routines that integrate technology breaks to protect executive function and facilitate daily self-care. Even brief periods of \"digital detox\" (e.g., 15-minute phone-free breaks) can improve executive function."

        "@type": "Answer",
