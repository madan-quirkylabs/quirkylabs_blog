Okay, real talk. It's 10:17 AM. I, Alex, am supposed to be finalizing the Q3 marketing report. Emphasis on *supposed*. Instead, I'm mentally composing a strongly worded email to HR about acceptable office snacking etiquette. My coworker, bless their heart, is currently auditioning for a mukbang ASMR channel with a bag of chips. Every crunch is a tiny ice pick to my brain.

"It's just a sound, Alex," I tell myself. "You're being dramatic. Focus!" But my brain is like a rogue DJ, stuck on repeat with the "Crunchy Snack Anthem." Maybe if I just alphabetize my stapler collection, the sound will magically disappear? No such luck. Now I'm color-coding sticky notes, because apparently, that's more urgent than a deadline. A little voice in the back of my head whispers, "You're failing. Again." I quickly bury it under a pile of paperclips. I'm not failing, I'm... optimizing my workspace for peak performance! Yeah, that's it.

Science TL;DR: Studies show ADHD brains often have trouble filtering out sensory input. That chewing sound? It's not just annoying; it's overloading your system. Your amygdala (the brain's alarm system) is going haywire, while your prefrontal cortex (the focus center) is MIA. This is called misophonia.

### ðŸŽ® SOLUTION QUEST

1. **Step 1: Name the Rage Beast.** Acknowledge the misophonia. Say it out loud: "That sound is triggering me." +5 XP.

### ðŸ”„ NARRATIVE REPLAY â€” "Take Two"

Okay, new plan. The marketing report still looms, but I'm armed with knowledge and (slightly) less rage. The chewing continues. This time, I whisper, "That sound is triggering me." It feels a little silly, but alsoâ€¦ empowering? I do the shoulder tense-and-release thing. It doesn't magically erase the sound, but it does dial down the panic. I grab my noise-canceling headphones. Ah, sweet silence. I get three sentences into the report before I realize I'm now humming along to the white noise. Baby steps. Maybe tomorrow I can find a better soundscape.
