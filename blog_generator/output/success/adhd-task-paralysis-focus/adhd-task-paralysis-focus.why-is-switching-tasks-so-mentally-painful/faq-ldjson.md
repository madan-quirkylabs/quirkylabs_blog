        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The \"intense mental friction\" you feel is due to deficits in inhibitory control and set-shifting in your brain (Barkley, 2012). It's not a smooth gear shift; it's a clunky, high-energy process that drains cognitive resources. Think of it as a neurobiological \"tax\" on every interruption."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This isn't just simple distraction; it's a neurological challenge. Cortese et al. (2020) found structural and functional abnormalities in prefrontal-striatal circuits in ADHD brains, making it much harder to flexibly switch between tasks. It's like your brain's \"context-switching software\" is running on an old, overloaded computer."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Absolutely not! This isn't a character flaw—it's a neurobiological response. Dodson (2016) links Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) to intense emotional pain in response to perceived criticism or failure, which can be triggered by interruptions. This is common with ADHD because your brain is wired differently."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, you're not alone. DuPaul et al. (2013) found that adults with ADHD exhibit significant deficits in executive functions, including task switching. This isn't laziness—it's a neurobiological barrier."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Use the 'Cognitive Clutch' protocol:\n1. **Pause**: Close your eyes and take a deep breath.\n2. **Visualize**: Imagine placing the current task in a box and putting it on a shelf.\n3. **Prepare**: Visualize taking a new, empty box off the shelf for the new task. This primes your brain for a smoother transition."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The 'Verbal Bridge' Hack: Say out loud, \"I am pausing [Task A] *and then* I will address [Task B].\" The act of speaking creates a deliberate bridge for your brain to cross, helping to overcome task paralysis."

        "text": "It uses neuro-strategic insights to identify your specific digital dopamine triggers and provides a Sensory-Smart Professional Toolkit for ADHD. It helps you manage interruptions and build \"cognitive shock absorbers\" to reduce the pain of transitions."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The OS allows you to pre-load a small 'dopamine treat' (e.g., a 1-minute YouTube short) that *only* becomes accessible for 5 minutes *after* successfully completing a planned task switch. This rewards the painful act of switching, making it easier to initiate."
