        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Your ADHD brain is uniquely vulnerable to the persuasive, dopamine-driven design of modern technology. The endless scroll, variable reward schedules of notifications, and constant novelty act as supernormal stimuli, hijacking dopamine pathways and impairing impulse control. This makes disengagement difficult and can lead to \"screen paralysis\" or \"digital dopamine traps.\""

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "While regular procrastination is often about delaying tasks, ADHD digital distraction is amplified by neurobiological differences. It's not just a choice; it's a vulnerability where technology's design actively exploits your brain's unique wiring (dopamine dysregulation, executive function deficits), making it incredibly difficult to initiate or switch away from stimulating digital content, leading to a \"freeze\" response."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, for individuals with ADHD and Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD), digital notifications can be significant triggers. The fear of a critical message, perceived slight, or missing out (FoMO) can cause intense emotional pain and anxiety, leading to avoidance of digital communication or hyper-vigilance towards pings, exacerbating digital task paralysis."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Because the ADHD brain's working memory, which holds your current intention, is like a small, unsecured notepad. Any new, interesting distraction can easily snatch it and wipe it clean. It's a neurological vulnerability, not a personal failing. Our Neuro-AI helps you build a secure, external \"second brain\" so your ideas are never lost."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Start by becoming aware of your personal triggers. What apps or websites are most likely to pull you in?

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Try using a tab management extension that allows you to group tabs into collapsible folders, decluttering your screen and reducing visual overwhelm. You can also use a tool that automatically suspends inactive tabs to free up memory and prevent distractions."
