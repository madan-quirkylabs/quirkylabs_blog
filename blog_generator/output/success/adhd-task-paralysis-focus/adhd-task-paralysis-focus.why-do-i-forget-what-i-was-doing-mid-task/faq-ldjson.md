      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Because the ADHD brain's working memory, which holds your current intention, is like a small, unsecured notepad. Any new, interesting distraction can easily snatch it and wipe it clean. It's a neurological vulnerability, not a personal failing. As Volkow et al. (2011) explain, dopamine dysregulation makes it harder to hold onto intentions."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "While regular procrastination is often about delaying tasks, ADHD digital distraction is amplified by neurobiological differences. It's not just a choice; it's a vulnerability where technology's design actively exploits your brain's unique wiring (dopamine dysregulation, executive function deficits), making it incredibly difficult to initiate or switch away from stimulating digital content, leading to a 'freeze' response. DuPaul et al. (2013) confirm widespread executive function deficits drive this task paralysis."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Why does the baffling and frustrating experience of having a clear task in mind, only for it to vanish into thin air the moment you get distracted, leaving you standing in a room with no idea why you entered happen?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The prefrontal cortex (PFC), responsible for working memory, has a neurologically 'smaller' or 'leakier' RAM in the ADHD brain. Jia et al. (2021) show that high-dopamine digital stimuli outcompete the original task for neural resources. This is common with ADHD because of the unique challenges in filtering and processing information."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This isn’t laziness—it’s a neurobiological barrier. Your prefrontal cortex is overloaded by distractions, leading to a working memory \"cache-clear\" event. Alderson et al. (2013) found working memory deficits significantly contribute to mid-task abandonment."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "You're not losing your mind, you're experiencing the 'Doorway Effect' on hyper-speed. For the ADHD brain, any context switch is a potential memory wipe. It’s a capacity issue, not an intelligence issue. Goodman (2020) links this to the \"brain fog\" symptom common in ADHD."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, for individuals with ADHD and Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD), digital notifications can be significant triggers. The fear of a critical message, perceived slight, or missing out (FoMO) can cause intense emotional pain and anxiety, leading to avoidance of digital communication or hyper-vigilance towards pings, exacerbating digital task paralysis. Dodson (2016) describes how RSD significantly contributes to task paralysis due to fear of criticism."
