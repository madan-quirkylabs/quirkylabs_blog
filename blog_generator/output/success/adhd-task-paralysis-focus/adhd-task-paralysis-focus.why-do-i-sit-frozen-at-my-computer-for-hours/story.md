### ðŸŽ¯ KILLER TITLE
Why Your ADHD Brain Gets Glued to the Screen (And How to Unstick It)

ðŸŽ¨ Visual Hook: "Include a DALLÂ·E prompt for a title image: 'Cartoon character with ADHD, trapped inside a computer screen filled with social media icons, pop-art style.'"

### ðŸ“– RELATABLE OPENING â€” "Take One"
Me: "I'll just check my email real quick." Also me, three hours later: "Wait, how did I end up watching a documentary about the history of paperclips?" 
ðŸ˜‚ Cartoon Prompt: "MidJourney: Overwhelmed office worker with a single email open, but surrounded by a vortex of distracting apps and websites, spiraling into the screen."

I, Alex, consider myself a digital native. I mean, I practically grew up with the internet. So, naturally, when my boss asked me to finalize the presentation deck, I figured, "Easy peasy, lemon squeezy!" I sat down at my computer, ready to conquer the task. First, though, a quick peek at Reddit. You know, to get the creative juices flowing. 

Five minutes turned into fifteen, fifteen into thirty. Before I knew it, I was deep in a thread about the best ergonomic keyboards for cats. Cats! I don't even *have* a cat. 

Okay, okay, back to the presentation. I opened the fileâ€¦ and immediately got a Slack notification. "Hey, quick question?" it read. "Sure," I thought, "I'm a team player!" The "quick question" led to a ten-minute detour explaining the nuances of Comic Sans (don't ask).

Back to the presentation. Again. This time, Instagram beckoned. Just one photo, I promised myself. One became ten, ten became twenty, and soon I was comparing vacation destinations with influencers I'd never met. 

Ugh. The guilt crept in. "Why can't I just *focus*?" I muttered, shoving the thought aside. "I'm justâ€¦ researching inspiration! Yeah, that's it. Market research."

### ðŸ”¬ SCIENCE ALERT

> - "Your brain's prefrontal cortex is stuck in 'dopamine-seeking' mode. Here's the cheat code."
> - ðŸŽ¨ Infographic Prompt: "Canva: A brain with a highway system. One lane leads to 'work' and is blocked by construction. The other lane leads to 'social media' and is a six-lane superhighway with flashing lights."

The truth is, it's not my fault (entirely). My ADHD brain is wired differently. According to Dr. Volkow (2011), dopamine dysregulation can lead to impaired effort-based decision-making. Basically, my brain is a grumpy cat that needs to be coaxed with treats, not forced into action. The digital world is a giant treat buffet, and my prefrontal cortex is a very weak bouncer.

### ðŸ”„ NARRATIVE REPLAY â€” "Take Two"
Okay, take two. This time, I was armed with knowledge and a plan. I sat down, sticky note with "FINALIZE DECK" plastered on my monitor. I even downloaded the "Dopamine Defender" (thanks, QuirkyLabs!).

First, I muted notifications on Slack, Instagram, and Reddit. Feels weirdlyâ€¦ empty? Good. Then, I closed all unnecessary tabs. Only the presentation file remained. I set a timer for 25 minutes. Digital Pomodoro, activate!

I managed a solid 15 minutes before my brain started itching for stimulation. I felt the pull of Reddit, whispering sweet nothings of cat videos and political outrage. I almost caved.

But then, the "Dopamine Defender" mini-game popped up. A quick, silly puzzle to redirect my attention. It worked! For about five minutes. Then, the urge returned, stronger this time. I caved and checked Instagram. Five minutes turned into ten. Sigh.

Okay, fail forward. I didn't stick to the plan perfectly, but I did manage to write three slides. Three! That's progress. Maybe next time, I'll try setting a shorter timer, or rewarding myself with a five-minute dance break after each slide. It's progress, right?
