        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Cortese et al. (2020) found dysfunction in fronto-striatal circuits, particularly those involving dopamine and norepinephrine, leading to impaired cognitive control, reward processing, and attentional regulation, resulting in 'brain freeze' or task initiation deficits. This makes initiating tasks, even when you know they're important, feel neurologically impossible."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's not just a matter of willpower! Volkow et al. (2011) found that dopamine dysregulation is a key neurobiological reason for the 'intention-to-action gap' in ADHD. Your brain isn't just 'choosing' not to start; it's struggling to register the future reward needed to kick into action, especially when bombarded by tempting digital dopamine traps."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This isn’t laziness—it’s a neurobiological barrier. Your prefrontal cortex is overloaded by the perceived effort cost of the task, coupled with a lack of immediate dopamine reward. This is common with ADHD because your brain's reward system is wired differently."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, difficulty with task initiation is a hallmark of ADHD. Barkley (2012) emphasizes that ADHD is fundamentally a disorder of executive functioning, leading to impairments in regulating attention, emotion, and behavior."
