      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Because your ADHD brain's reward system runs on dopamine, and it's not getting enough of a \"dopamine forecast\" from the long-term benefit of an important task. It's a neurochemical standoff, not a lack of desire. Our Neuro-AI identifies your specific dopamine deficit and offers a personalized \"jump-start\" protocol."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "While regular procrastination is often about delaying tasks, ADHD digital distraction is amplified by neurobiological differences. It's not just a choice; it's a vulnerability where technology's design actively exploits your brain's unique wiring (dopamine dysregulation, executive function deficits), making it incredibly difficult to initiate or switch away from stimulating digital content, leading to a \"freeze\" response."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, for individuals with ADHD and Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD), digital notifications can be significant triggers. The fear of a critical message, perceived slight, or missing out (FoMO) can cause intense emotional pain and anxiety, leading to avoidance of digital communication or hyper-vigilance towards pings, exacerbating digital task paralysis."

      "name": "Why can't I start tasks even when it's important?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Dopamine dysregulation is a key neurobiological reason for the \"intention-to-action gap\" and task paralysis in ADHD. Reduced dopamine availability or receptor sensitivity in the striatum and prefrontal cortex diminishes the motivational \"signal\" for initiating tasks that are not immediately rewarding. This makes the cognitive \"cost\" of effort seem higher, leading to inaction."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Emotional dysregulation is a highly prevalent and impactful feature of adult ADHD, contributing to task paralysis through overwhelming feelings. Shame and fear of failure create a significant emotional barrier to task initiation. Interventions must focus on self-compassion, reducing perceived threats, and breaking tasks into micro-steps."

      "name": "Why do I forget what I was doing mid-task?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Working memory deficits in ADHD contribute to mid-task abandonment and forgetfulness. These deficits impact the ability to hold information in mind, follow multi-step instructions, and remember goals during task execution. Strategies for working memory support include externalizing information (e.g., written lists, visual cues), and breaking tasks into smaller steps."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Your ADHD brain is uniquely vulnerable to the persuasive, dopamine-driven design of modern technology. The endless scroll, variable reward schedules of notifications, and constant novelty act as supernormal stimuli, hijacking dopamine pathways and impairing impulse control. This makes disengagement difficult and can lead to \"screen paralysis\" or \"digital dopamine traps.\""

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Impaired inhibitory control in ADHD exacerbates task paralysis by making it difficult to resist distractions and switch tasks. Adults with ADHD exhibit significant and widespread deficits across various domains of executive function, including planning, organization, and task switching."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Several factors can contribute to this. Sensory overload is common in ADHD and can directly trigger mental shutdown and task paralysis. Also, ADHD significantly increases vulnerability to problematic internet use, directly fueling digital task paralysis and distraction. Misdirected hyperfocus can lead to neglect of important tasks, time blindness, and difficulties disengaging, contributing to overall task paralysis. \"Brain fog\" is also a common ADHD symptom contributing to mental immobilization and task paralysis."
