### **Why Your ADHD Brain Blue-Screens at Work (And the 10-Second Reboot)**

ðŸŽ¨ *Visual Hook: Include a DALLÂ·E prompt for a title image: 'Frustrated cartoon character staring at a frozen computer screen, pop-art style.'"*

ðŸ“– **RELATABLE OPENING â€” "Take One"**

Me: "Okay, gotta start that presentation. It's, like, *the* most important thing this week."
Also me, 20 minutes later: "Wait, how many species of penguins are there? And do they *all* waddle?"
ðŸ˜‚ *Cartoon Prompt: MidJourney: â€˜Overwhelmed office worker with 57 browser tabs, one labeled â€˜Important Presentationâ„¢â€™ with a giant red arrow.â€™*

It starts innocently enough, right? You open your laptop, ready to conquer the day. The presentation looms large, a deadline monster breathing down your neck. "No problem," you think. "I've got this."

Famous last words.

Suddenly, your brain decides that knowing the precise wingspan of a Golden Eagle is *absolutely crucial* forâ€¦ reasons. You tell yourself it's research. "Background," you mutter, clicking on the Wikipedia link. An hour melts away.

Then, guilt creeps in. "Shouldn't I be, you know, *working*?" you whisper to your desk plant. It doesn't answer, but the shame is palpable. "Okay, okay, focus time." You close the eagle tab (reluctantly) and stare at the blank PowerPoint.

A notification pops up: "Slack: Hey, quick questionâ€¦"

And down the rabbit hole you go. Five minutes turns into fifty. You're now an expert on the history of staplers. Seriously.

A tiny voice in your head whispers, "You're such a failure. Why can't you just *do* the thing?" You quickly squash it down. "Nah, I'm justâ€¦ a curious person! Yeah, that's it."

### ðŸ”„ **NARRATIVE REPLAY â€” "Take Two"**

Okay, new strategy. You remember the article (this one, actually!). "Not now," you whisper to the sudden urge to Google "best ergonomic office chairs." You make a quick cup of tea, enjoying the ritual.

You sit back down, open the presentation, andâ€¦ blank screen. Ugh. You almost give in to the urge to check Instagram. Almost.

Then, you remember: one sentence. You type: "Slide 1: Introduction."

And thenâ€¦ you stare at it. For five minutes. It's not brilliant, but it's *something*. Progress!

But wait, now you're thinking about fonts. And animations. And the perfect opening joke. "NO!" you shout (internally). You close the presentation.

A wave of frustration washes over you. "This isn't working!"

But thenâ€¦ you remember the tea. It's still warm. You take a sip, and a tiny spark of hope flickers. "Okay," you think. "Maybe tomorrow I'll tryâ€¦ two sentences."
