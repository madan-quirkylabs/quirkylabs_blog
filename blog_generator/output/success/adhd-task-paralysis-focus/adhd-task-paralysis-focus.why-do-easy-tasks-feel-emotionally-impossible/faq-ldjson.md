        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "When your brain perceives an \"easy task,\" the amygdala, hyper-sensitized by past negative experiences, fires a \"threat\" signal. This isn't logical; it's a conditioned emotional response that hijacks the prefrontal cortex, leading to paralysis or avoidance. (Dolin, 2018)."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This isn’t laziness; it’s a neurobiological barrier. Executive function deficits (Barkley, 2012) and emotional dysregulation (Skirrow & McLoughlin, 2016) in ADHD mean your brain processes tasks differently. It's not a choice; it's a threat response."

        "text": "Execute a 5-second 'Amygdala Handshake.' Place a hand over your heart, take one slow breath, and say (in your head or out loud), 'This feeling is a misfire, not a monster.' This acknowledges the feeling without validating it as a real danger, priming your PFC for regulation. Then, use the 'Just Touch It' Rule: Just physically touch the object associated with it (the phone, the dirty dish, the laundry basket). That is the entire victory for now."

That is the entire victory for now. Or use the 'Two-Minute Timer' Mission: Set a timer for two minutes. Do the \"easy task\" for just that long. You are required to stop when the timer goes off. The goal is to start, not finish."

The most helpful thing you can do is not focus on the task, but just validate the feeling, like saying, 'I know this feels huge right now. No pressure.'\"*"

Try the ‘Emotional Scaffolding Playlist’: AI generates a 3-song playlist for a dreaded task. Song 1 is calming to lower the emotional barrier, Song 2 is high-energy to power through the task, and Song 3 is celebratory for finishing."
