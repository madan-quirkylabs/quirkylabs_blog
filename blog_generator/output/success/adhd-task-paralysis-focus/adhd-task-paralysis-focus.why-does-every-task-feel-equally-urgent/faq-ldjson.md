      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Because of a core ADHD trait called \"time blindness,\" your brain struggles to place tasks in the future. This causes all tasks to feel like they are due \"NOW,\" and your brain's executive functions get overwhelmed trying to sort them, leading to everything feeling equally, catastrophically urgent. Our Neuro-AI helps you build an 'external clock' to give your brain the context it needs."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "While regular procrastination is often about delaying tasks, ADHD digital distraction is amplified by neurobiological differences. It's not just a choice; it's a vulnerability where technology's design actively exploits your brain's unique wiring (dopamine dysregulation, executive function deficits), making it incredibly difficult to initiate or switch away from stimulating digital content, leading to a \"freeze\" response."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, for individuals with ADHD and Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD), digital notifications can be significant triggers. The fear of a critical message, perceived slight, or missing out (FoMO) can cause intense emotional pain and anxiety, leading to avoidance of digital communication or hyper-vigilance towards pings, exacerbating digital task paralysis."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "You're not crazy, your brain's 'urgency filter' is offline. Without it, every notification is a potential bomb. Here’s the 2-minute 'Triage Tool' to help you spot the difference between a real bomb and a dud. Your brain isn't chaotic—it's just getting spammed with false alarms."

      "name": "Why does my ADHD brain get stuck on screens?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Your ADHD brain is uniquely vulnerable to the persuasive, dopamine-driven design of modern technology. The endless scroll, variable reward schedules of notifications, and constant novelty act as supernormal stimuli, hijacking dopamine pathways and impairing impulse control. This makes disengagement difficult and can lead to 'screen paralysis' or 'digital dopamine traps.'"

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Your brain's priority filter just crashed. Before looking at your task list, activate the 'Time Telescope.' Pick one task you think is important. Close your eyes and vividly imagine the negative consequence if you *don't* do it this week. Now feel the relief of it being done. This helps your prefrontal cortex assign a proper value and urgency to the task."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Implement a 'Notification Funnel': Block all notifications by default and 'funnel' them into a single digest delivered only at pre-set times (e.g., 11 AM and 4 PM). Truly urgent messages from pre-approved contacts can bypass the funnel, creating a manageable and hierarchical information flow."
