      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This is due to \"time blindness,\" where your brain struggles to accurately perceive future timelines, making everything feel like it's due *now*. Cortese et al. (2020) found that dysfunction in fronto-striatal circuits impairs cognitive control and attentional regulation, leading to this \"priority collapse.\""

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's not just about poor planning; it's a neurobiological difference. Pollak & Fried (2017) demonstrated that adults with ADHD show significant impairments in time estimation, leading to chronic lateness and difficulty prioritizing. This is your brain's unique wiring, not a character flaw."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Sensory overload is common in ADHD, and digital environments are often intensely stimulating. Panagiotidi et al. (2018) found a significant overlap between ADHD and sensory processing sensitivity. This can lead to mental shutdown and task paralysis."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This isn't laziness—it's a neurobiological barrier. Your prefrontal cortex struggles to assign different weights of importance to tasks due to \"time blindness\". Remember, Kessler et al. (2009) emphasize that understanding the neurobiological basis of symptoms is crucial for reducing self-blame."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, this is a common experience. Executive function deficits, particularly in planning and organization, are a core feature of ADHD. DuPaul et al. (2013) showed that these deficits significantly contribute to real-world functional difficulties."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's not simply a lack of willpower. Jia et al. (2021) found that individuals with ADHD are at higher risk for problematic internet use due to dopamine dysregulation, leading to digital task paralysis. This is about your brain's reward system, not a moral failing."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Activate the 'Time Telescope.' Pick one task you think is important. Close your eyes and vividly imagine the negative consequence if you *don't* do it this week. Now feel the relief of it being done. This helps your prefrontal cortex assign a proper value and urgency to the task."

        "text": "Use the 'One Thing' Focus: Write your single most important task on a sticky note and place it on your monitor. That is the *only* to-do list that exists in the universe until it is done. This helps to minimize overwhelm when executive resources are limited."

        "text": "Implement the '1-3-5' List: Each day, choose only: 1 big/hard thing, 3 medium things, and 5 small/easy things to accomplish. This forces you to create a simple hierarchy and limits the size of the list."

        "text": "Our system includes 'Value-Assignment Training,' a gamified tool where you rapidly sort tasks into categories (e.g., 'Makes Money/Saves Job' vs. 'Doesn't') to train your brain to more quickly assign high-value flags to professionally critical tasks. This supports the development of new neural pathways for improved decision-making."
