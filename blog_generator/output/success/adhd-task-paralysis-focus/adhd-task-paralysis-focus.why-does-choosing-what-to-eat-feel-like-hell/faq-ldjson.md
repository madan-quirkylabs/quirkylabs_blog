      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Because for the ADHD brain, \"choosing food\" is not one task; it's a dozen executive function tasks in a row (planning, sequencing, recall, etc.). This sequence overloads your prefrontal cortex, causing a system crash we call \"decision paralysis.\" *Our Neuro-AI helps you bypass this crash by creating simple, pre-decision systems.*"

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's not just about being picky. It's about your executive function system getting overwhelmed. The ADHD brain struggles with the many steps involved in choosing a meal, from assessing hunger to evaluating options. This can lead to a \"freeze\" response, even when you're starving."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Absolutely. Repeatedly failing at something as fundamental as choosing food can create a \"Shame-Anchor-Loop,\" linking self-nourishment to a core belief of being an incapable adult. This isn't about the food; it's about reinforcing a painful identity of being \"broken.\""

        "@type": "Answer",

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "When faced with overwhelming food choices, your brain often fails to generate a strong dopamine \"reward\" signal for any single option. This \"dopamine void\" makes the effort of choosing and preparing food feel immense and unrewarding."

        "text": "Try the \"Single-Ingredient\" Protocol. Instead of deciding on a full meal, decide on only one ingredient you feel like eating (e.g., \"chicken\"). Then, look up a simple recipe using only that one ingredient. This breaks the decision down into a less overwhelming sequence."
