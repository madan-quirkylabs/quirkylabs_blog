      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This is because the act of planning is a creative, dopamine-friendly activity, while execution is often perceived as boring or effortful. Cortese et al. (2020) show that dysfunction in fronto-striatal circuits, particularly those involving dopamine, leads to impaired cognitive control, reward processing, and attentional regulation, resulting in a 'brain freeze' when you try to switch gears. It's like your brain runs out of gas right when you need to drive!"

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's not just procrastination—it's a neurobiological difference. Volkow et al. (2011) found that dopamine dysregulation in ADHD makes it difficult for the brain to activate for tasks requiring sustained effort or delayed reward. This makes the cognitive \"cost\" of effort seem higher, leading to inaction. You're not lazy; your brain's reward system is wired differently!"

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This isn't a moral failing—it's a neurobiological barrier. Your prefrontal cortex is struggling to transition from the dopamine-rich planning phase to the less-stimulating execution phase. Dolin (2018) describes the 'Wall of Awful' – an emotional barrier preventing task initiation, built from accumulated negative experiences, shame, and fear of judgment or failure. Try our \"Neuro-Unfreeze Method™\" to build a bridge across this canyon."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, this is a common ADHD experience. Barkley (2012) explains that ADHD is fundamentally a disorder of executive functioning, leading to impairments in regulating attention, emotion, and behavior. This difficulty in self-regulation explains why \"easy\" tasks can feel emotionally impossible."

This leverages dopamine to kickstart momentum."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It uses a neuro-strategic approach to bypass prefrontal cortex blockage. Our AI \"identifies your specific friction point and offers a personalized 'on-ramp',\" helping you build a \"dopamine ramp\" from your plan to your first action. For example, the ‘Single-Step View’ Protocol syncs with planners like Notion and uses an overlay to gray out the entire plan except for the single, next actionable item, eliminating visual overwhelm (Panagiotidi et al., 2018)."
