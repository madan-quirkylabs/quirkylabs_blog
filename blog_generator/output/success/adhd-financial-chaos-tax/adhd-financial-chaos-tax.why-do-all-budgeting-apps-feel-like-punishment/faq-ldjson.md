        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Managing money with ADHD is challenging due to neurobiological differences impacting executive functions (planning, organization, working memory), emotional dysregulation (leading to impulse spending), and time blindness (causing late fees). It's not a lack of effort, but a mismatch between your brain's wiring and neurotypical financial systems. (See: Suhr & Reynolds, 2019; Duell & Wagner, 2020)"

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The \"ADHD Tax\" refers to the cumulative, often hidden, financial and time costs incurred due to ADHD symptoms. This includes late fees from forgotten bills, replacing lost items, unused subscriptions, and regretted impulse purchases. It's a real and measurable burden for many ADHD adults. (See: Pollak & Fried, 2020)"

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Absolutely not. ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that fundamentally impacts executive functioning. It's neurologically challenging to plan, initiate, and complete tasks, *regardless* of an individual's desire or effort. (See: Castellanos et al., 2006) Your brain works differently, not deficiently. It's a matter of wiring, not willpower!"

      "name": "Why do all budgeting apps feel like punishment?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Traditional budgeting apps often require meticulous planning, sustained attention, and detailed input, which can quickly overwhelm the ADHD brain. This triggers decision fatigue and a low dopamine return for the effort expended, making the task feel disproportionately high and, frankly, unpleasant."

      "name": "Why is saving money so hard with ADHD?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "ADHD is characterized by atypical reward processing, including altered sensitivity to delay discounting (preference for immediate over delayed rewards). This neuroeconomic bias contributes to financial impulsivity, risk-taking, and difficulty with long-term financial planning. (See: Sonuga-Barke et al., 2021)"

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Focus on radical simplification, automation, and visual tools. Automate bills and savings, use visual budgeting methods (like color-coded charts), and break down financial tasks into small, manageable steps. Prioritize strategies that minimize cognitive load and maximize dopamine rewards."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Implement \"cooling-off\" periods before making non-essential purchases. Use pre-commitment devices (like freezing your credit card), and explore strategies for emotional regulation to address the underlying emotional triggers of impulse spending. (See: Amlung & MacKillop, 2014)"
