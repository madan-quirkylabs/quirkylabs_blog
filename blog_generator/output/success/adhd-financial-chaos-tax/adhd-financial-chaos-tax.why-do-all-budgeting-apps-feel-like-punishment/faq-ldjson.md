        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Suhr & Reynolds (2019) highlight that ADHD brains often struggle with financial planning due to impairments in the prefrontal cortex, affecting working memory, inhibition, and planning. This makes complex financial computations feel overwhelming. This is common with ADHD because it's not a lack of intelligence, but a neurobiological difference."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's not just about lacking knowledge! Duell & Wagner (2020) found that executive function deficits, common in ADHD, directly undermine the ability to manage finances. It’s a neurobiological barrier, not a moral failing."

        "text": "Sonuga-Barke et al. (2021) explain that ADHD involves atypical reward processing, leading to a preference for immediate rewards over delayed ones. This contributes to financial impulsivity. This is your brain seeking dopamine, even if it's detrimental in the long run."
