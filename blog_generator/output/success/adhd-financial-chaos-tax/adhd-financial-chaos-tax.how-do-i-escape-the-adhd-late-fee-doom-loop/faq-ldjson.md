      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Managing money with ADHD is challenging due to neurobiological differences impacting executive functions (planning, organization, working memory), emotional dysregulation (leading to impulse spending), and time blindness (causing late fees). It's not a lack of effort, but a mismatch between your brain's wiring and neurotypical financial systems."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The \"ADHD Tax\" refers to the cumulative, often hidden, financial and time costs incurred due to ADHD symptoms. This includes late fees from forgotten bills, replacing lost items, unused subscriptions, and regretted impulse purchases. It's a real and measurable burden for many ADHD adults."

        "@type": "Answer",

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
