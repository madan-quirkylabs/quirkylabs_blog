        "text": "This isn't laziness—it's a neurobiological barrier. Your prefrontal cortex receives a \"threat\" signal from your amygdala, triggering task paralysis. This isn't a moral failing, but a specific \"Shame-Anchor Neuro-Loop ID: MedicalBill_Avoidance_Shame_004\". Try our Neuro-Communication Protocol to rewire this. Knouse & Mitchell (2016) found high levels of shame and self-blame are common in adults with ADHD, which often leads to avoidance."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, this is common with ADHD because of executive dysfunction and emotional dysregulation. Rosén et al. (2019) found that adults with ADHD are at a significantly higher risk of experiencing long-term financial strain. It's not a personal failing, it's a neurodevelopmental challenge."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This is because your prefrontal cortex, responsible for initiating tasks, receives a \"threat\" signal from your amygdala due to past negative experiences or generalized financial anxiety. This triggers task paralysis and emotional dysregulation. As Richardson et al. (2013) found, financial difficulties are significantly associated with poorer mental health outcomes."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This is different because ADHD brains process financial information and make decisions differently due to impairments in prefrontal cortex functions. Suhr & Reynolds (2019) show that adults with ADHD exhibit deficits in financial decision-making due to executive dysfunction and impulsivity. It's a neurobiological difference, not a lack of knowledge."
