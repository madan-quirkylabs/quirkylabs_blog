      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Your brain's reward pathways (mesolimbic dopamine system) show heightened activity when a novel item or 'deal' appears, triggering an intense desire for immediate gratification. Due to dopamine dysregulation common in ADHD, the anticipated reward from a purchase provides a stronger 'hit' than sustained effort for long-term goals (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2021). This is your brain seeking that dopamine boost!"

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's not just a treat. In ADHD, there's dysregulation in reward pathways and emotional processing centers (amygdala), leading to difficulty delaying gratification and using spending for self-soothing (Lenzi et al., 2021). It’s a neurobiological drive, not just a desire."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This is a 'Default Mode Network' hijack, where your brain fixates on the immediate benefits and suppresses thoughts of future consequences. The anticipatory pleasure mechanism is often heightened in ADHD, contributing to impulsive decisions (Knutson et al., 2001)."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This isn’t a moral failing—it’s a neurobiological barrier. Your brain's reward system prioritizes immediate, potent stimuli (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2021). This makes resisting the impulse neurologically challenging."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, it's a common experience. Higher ADHD symptom severity predicts problematic financial behavior, with emotion dysregulation significantly mediating this relationship (Lenzi et al., 2021). You're not alone in this struggle."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Absolutely not! While adults with persistent ADHD symptoms are at a higher risk of accumulating debt (Loo et al., 2015), understanding the neurobiological roots and using ADHD-friendly strategies can help you regain control."
