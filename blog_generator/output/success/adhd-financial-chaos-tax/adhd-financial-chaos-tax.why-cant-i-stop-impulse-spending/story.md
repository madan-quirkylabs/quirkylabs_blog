Me: “I’m just going to browse Amazon for 5 minutes.”
Also me, three hours later: “Why do I own a taxidermied squirrel wearing a tiny hat?”

It’s a Tuesday afternoon. Sarah, a graphic designer, is working from home. She’s got a looming deadline, a project proposal due by end of day. "I'll just check my email real quick," she thinks, eyes darting to the little notification icon. Five minutes later, she’s deep in a rabbit hole of “must-have” art supplies. "It's for work, kinda," she tells herself, justifying the impulse. A set of limited-edition watercolor pencils catches her eye. "They're 40% off! I'd be losing money *not* buying them!" She adds them to her cart.

Then the doubts creep in. "I already have three sets of watercolors," she thinks, a familiar wave of guilt washing over her. "What if I don't even use them? Ugh, I'm so irresponsible." She tries to brush it off. "It's just a little treat. I deserve it." But the shame lingers, a quiet voice whispering, "Why can’t you just be normal?" She clicks "checkout."

Later that evening, staring at the unopened package, Sarah wonders if she'll ever escape this cycle. "I'm intelligent in my career," she thinks, "but I'm completely incompetent with money. What's wrong with me?"

### 🧠 Short Circuit: The Dopamine Drain

- Your brain’s reward system is craving a hit. Impulse buys are like a dopamine IV drip. Here’s how to unplug.
- 🎨 Infographic Prompt: *Canva: Side-by-side brain scans. Neurotypical brain: steady dopamine release during work. ADHD brain: flatline during work, massive spike during online shopping.*

Science TL;DR: Studies show ADHD brains have altered reward processing (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2021). That means a stronger pull towards instant gratification and a harder time delaying it. It's not a lack of willpower, it's a neurobiological reality (Castellanos et al., 2006). Executive dysfunction (Duell & Wagner, 2020) makes it harder to resist those urges, and emotional dysregulation (Lenzi et al., 2021) can turn spending into a coping mechanism. The "ADHD tax" (Pollak & Fried, 2020) is real, and it's costing you more than just money.

### 🔄 NARRATIVE REPLAY — "Take Two"

Sarah, armed with her newfound knowledge, faced her next online shopping temptation. A targeted ad for a fancy new gadget popped up on her screen. Her brain buzzed with excitement. "Ooh, shiny!" she thought. But this time, she recognized the trigger. "Okay, this is just my dopamine talking," she said aloud.

She set a 5-minute timer and closed the tab. She went for a quick walk around the block, listening to her favorite upbeat music. When she returned, the urge had subsided. "I don't really need that gadget," she realized. "It's just another distraction."

She didn't eliminate the urge entirely, but this time, she didn't give in. She felt a small sense of accomplishment. "Huh," she thought. "That sucked slightly less. What if I tried [finding a free online course] next time?" Maybe I’m not broken—just under-resourced. Maybe.
