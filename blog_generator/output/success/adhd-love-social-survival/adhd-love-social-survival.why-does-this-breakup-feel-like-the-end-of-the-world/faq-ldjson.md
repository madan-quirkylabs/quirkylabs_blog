        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "No! This isn't just being dramatic. For ADHD brains, breakup pain is profoundly amplified by emotional dysregulation and Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD), often feeling like physical pain or trauma. It's a genuine neurobiological response, not an overreaction. Kross et al. (2011) found that social rejection activates the same brain regions as physical pain. This is common with ADHD because of the hyperactive amygdala response and underactive prefrontal regulation. It's your brain, not your fault."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Absolutely not. This is a **neurobiological barrier**, not a moral failing. Schrevel et al. (2016) found that adults with ADHD show significant deficits in emotional regulation strategies and increased rumination, which are strongly linked to depressive symptoms. Your brain’s fronto-limbic networks are struggling to disengage from negative thoughts. Try our **Neuro-Affirming Grief Protocol** to rewire this. This is common with ADHD because of the fronto-limbic dysfunction."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Kross et al. (2011) showed that intense social rejection activates brain regions associated with physical pain. Dodson (n.d.) explains that Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) causes extreme, unbearable emotional pain following perceived rejection, which can feel physical and lead to \"meltdowns.\" This is common with ADHD because of the hyperactive limbic response."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Shaw et al. (2014) found that emotional dysregulation is a significant feature of ADHD, distinct from comorbid mood disorders, impacting daily functioning. Magdi et al. (2025) found a high comorbidity between ADHD and PTSD, suggesting vulnerability to trauma. The heightened emotional reactivity and memory processing issues in ADHD may cause individuals to experience severe breakups as traumatic events. This is common with ADHD because of the difficulties in fronto-limbic circuits."

After the initial rumination is identified, it offers a quick win task from the QuirkyLabs OS to redirect focus from regret to agency.\n3. This is common with ADHD because of the dopamine dysregulation and executive function deficits."
