### **ðŸ’” Why Your ADHD Brain Thinks Every Breakup Is the END OF THE WORLD (And How to Hit Reset)**

*Me: Finally starting to feel okay after the breakup.*
*My brain: Remember that one time they looked at you funny?*
*Also my brain: Play that memory on a loop for the next 72 hours.*

Okay, real talk. Breakups suck for everyone. But if you have ADHD, it can feel like someone detonated a nuclear bomb in your emotional landscape. The intensity of the pain, the endless rumination, the feeling that you'll never be happy againâ€¦ it's all dialed up to eleven.

And the worst part? It's not "just being sensitive." Your brain is *literally* wired to experience rejection and emotional pain more intensely.

ðŸ“– **RELATABLE OPENING â€” "Take One"**

It started innocently enough. Sarah, armed with a box of tissues and a pint of Ben & Jerry's (Chocolate Therapy, naturally), decided to "be productive" and clean out her closet. "Closure cleaning," she called it. Step one: tackle the dreaded "Ex Box."

"Okay, brain," she muttered, "Operation: Move On is a go."

Five minutes later, Sarah was sprawled on the floor, clutching a faded concert ticket stub from a show she and Mark had seen three years ago. "We were so happy then," she wailed dramatically. "Brain, why are you doing this to me?!"

The brain, of course, offered no helpful answers, only a highlight reel of every awkward moment, every unanswered text, and every perceived slight from the past six months.

"Okay, new plan," Sarah announced to her cat, Mr. Fluffernutter. "I just need toâ€¦distract myself. Yeah, that's it! I'll just scroll through TikTok for a little bit."

Three hours, a deep dive into ASMR slime videos, and a near-existential crisis later, Sarah resurfaced, feeling even worse than before. She'd seen approximately 7,543 videos of "perfect couples" doing impossibly romantic things. "Why can't *I* have that?" she sobbed, scrolling through Mark's Instagram (she knew she shouldn't, but the impulse was too strong). He was at a brewery with friends, laughing and seemingly carefree.

A wave of nausea washed over her. "I need to text him," she thought desperately. "Just toâ€¦see if he's okay. Yeah, that's it! I'm just being a good person."

Luckily, her phone was dead. "Thank you, tiny phone battery, for saving me from myself," she whispered.

But the feeling of being adrift, alone, and utterly broken was overwhelming. "I'm never going to get over this," she thought, curling up in a fetal position. "This is it. This is the end of the world."

A little voice whispered in the back of her mind: *You're being dramatic. Just get over it.*

Sarah immediately dismissed it. "Shut up, brain," she mumbled. "You don't understand anything."

*Your brain's amygdala (the emotion center) is stuck in DEFCON 1. Here's the cheat code to disarm it.*

> -   Emotional dysregulation in ADHD is linked to dysfunctional prefrontal cortex control over limbic (emotion) regions, particularly the amygdala, affecting impulse control in emotional and relational contexts.
> -   Early intervention programs targeting ED may benefit the developmental trajectory of romantic relationships among youth with ADHD.
> -   Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) causes extreme, unbearable emotional pain following perceived rejection, making breakups exceptionally difficult.

ðŸ”„ **NARRATIVE REPLAY â€” "Take Two"**

Sarah, armed with her newfound knowledge and a slightly less-melted pint of ice cream, decided to try again.

"Okay, brain," she said, "Take Two. This time, we're doing things differently."

She started by whispering, "Rejection Overload." It felt a little silly, but alsoâ€¦ strangely empowering.

Then, she grabbed her journal and set a 2-minute timer. After a solid minute of staring blankly at the page, she finally managed to write: "I feel like I'm drowning."

"Okay, that's one sentence," she said to Mr. Fluffernutter, who blinked back at her with an air of profound wisdom.

Next, she reached for her favorite cashmere blanket and wrapped it around herself. She focused on the soft texture, the warmth, the feeling of being held. It wasâ€¦ soothing.

Then came the hard part: the phone. She downloaded a blocker app and set it to block Instagram for two hours. A wave of panic washed over her. "What if I miss something important?" she thought.

But then she remembered the alternative dopamine source: a silly puzzle game she'd downloaded on a whim. She opened the app and started matching colorful candies.

It wasn't a perfect transformation. She still thought about Mark. She still felt a pang of sadness. But the intensity of the pain had lessened, the rumination had quieted down, and she didn't feel like the world was ending anymore.

"Huh," she said to Mr. Fluffernutter. "That sucked slightly less. Maybe I'm not brokenâ€”just under-resourced. Maybe."
