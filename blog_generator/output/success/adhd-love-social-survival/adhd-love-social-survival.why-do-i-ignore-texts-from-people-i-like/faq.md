### **Comprehensive FAQ: Neuro-Harmonizing Your Love Life: Practical Hacks for Thriving ADHD Relationships & Deep Connection**

#### **Category 1: Neuro-Why**
**Q: Why does 'involuntary ghosting' feel like quicksand on my good intentions?**
**A:** The ADHD brain registers a notification (salience network), but executive function processes struggle to engage. The message is pushed 'out of sight, out of mind,' and your prefrontal cortex tries to initiate, but the amygdala fires a 'threat' signal, triggering 'communication paralysis' (Spoke Metadata).

**Q: How is this different from just being a bad texter?**
**A:** It's a neurobiological response, not a moral failing. ADHD brains have deficits in fronto-limbic networks, impairing the ability to disengage from negative thoughts and regulate intense emotions (Schrevel et al., 2016).

#### **Category 2: Shame Disruptors**
**Q: Am I a bad friend because I can’t reply to texts?**
**A:** This isn’t laziness—it’s a neurobiological barrier. Your Shame-Anchor Neuro-Loop ID: Involuntary_Ghosting_001 associates communication delays with being a "bad friend," fostering chronic guilt (Spoke Metadata).

**Q: Does everyone with ADHD struggle with this?**
**A:** Yes! Executive function deficits (planning, organization, emotional regulation) create negative relationship cycles. Psychoeducation helps reframe these as neurobiological (Orlov, 2010).

#### **Category 3: Practical Hacks**
**Q: What’s the first step when 'communication paralysis' hits?**
**A:** Use the QuirkyLabs "1% Communication Rule":
1. Send one emoji back.
2. Set a 30-second haptic timer for initiation.
3. Give yourself a micro-reward for completion (Spoke Metadata).

**Q: How do I reply to texts when I’m in ‘Spoonie Mode’?**
**A:** Try the "5-Minute Texting Blitz": AI-curated short window for focused replies + adaptive sensory cues for optimal engagement and a quick dopamine hit from clearing the inbox (Spoke Metadata).

#### **Category 4: Social Scripts**
**Q: How do I explain my 'involuntary ghosting' to my partner?**
**A:** AI-generated script: *"[Partner], sometimes my ADHD brain struggles with 'texting paralysis' even when I love hearing from you. It's not you, it's my executive function. Can we try voice notes sometimes, or would it help if I only opened texts when I'm ready to reply?'"* (Spoke Metadata).

#### **Category 5: Advanced Tools**
**Q: How does QuirkyLabs' "Reply Roulette 2.0" short-circuit 'communication paralysis'?**
**A:** It gamifies texting with AI-generated micro-rewards, dynamically weighted by communication difficulty and your motivational profile, providing novelty and immediate gratification to reinforce consistent digital engagement (Solution War Room).
