      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Unintentional \"ghosting\" or delayed responses often stem from ADHD-related executive dysfunction, not a lack of care. This can include \"out of sight, out of mind\" object permanence issues (if a message isn't immediately visible, it can be forgotten), task initiation paralysis for replying, notification overwhelm, or difficulty managing the \"social battery.\" The intention to reply is present, but the brain struggles with the activation energy needed to follow through, leading to guilt and shame. *Our Neuro-AI helps you identify specific triggers and offers personalized communication hacks.*"

      "name": "Is \"involuntary ghosting\" a real thing, or am I just making excuses for being a bad friend?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's absolutely real! \"Involuntary ghosting\" is a common experience for individuals with ADHD, rooted in neurobiological differences. Studies show that executive function deficits and dopamine dysregulation can significantly impact communication patterns. It's not about being intentionally rude or uncaring; it's about your brain's unique wiring."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How does ADHD actually *cause* me to forget to reply to people I like?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Several factors are at play. Executive dysfunction makes it hard to prioritize replying over other stimuli. \"Out of sight, out of mind\" means that if the notification isn't immediately visible, it's easily forgotten. Notification overwhelm can lead to avoidance. And Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) can create anxiety around crafting the \"perfect\" response, leading to paralysis."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "I feel terrible when I realize I've unintentionally ghosted someone. Why does the guilt hit so hard?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The guilt is often amplified by a lifetime of being misunderstood and criticized for ADHD-related challenges. The ADHD brain is also wired for intense emotional responses, so feelings of shame and self-blame can be overwhelming. Plus, the fear of damaging relationships with people you care about adds another layer of anxiety."

      "name": "Okay, so it's not my fault. But how do I actually *stop* unintentionally ghosting people?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Start by understanding your triggers. Are you more likely to ghost when you're overwhelmed, distracted, or feeling anxious? Once you know your triggers, you can implement strategies to manage them. This might involve setting designated \"reply times,\" using reminder apps, or communicating your needs to your loved ones."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Try breaking down the task into smaller steps. Instead of trying to write a long, thoughtful reply, start with a simple emoji or a quick \"thinking of you\" message. Use templates for common replies to reduce the cognitive load. And consider voice notes or video messages as alternatives to texting."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Turn off non-essential notifications and customize your notification settings to reduce the number of pings and chimes. Designate specific times for checking your messages and avoid constantly checking your phone. And create \"digital-free zones\" where you can disconnect and recharge."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Be honest and direct. You could say something like, \"I have ADHD, which sometimes makes it hard for me to keep up with texts. It's not that I don't care; it's just that my brain works a little differently. I'm working on it, and I appreciate your understanding.\""

Use analogies to help them understand what it's like to experience executive dysfunction or notification overwhelm. And emphasize that you care about them and are committed to finding solutions."
