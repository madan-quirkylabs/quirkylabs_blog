        "text": "The ADHD brain registers a notification (salience network), but executive function processes struggle to engage. The message is pushed 'out of sight, out of mind,' and your prefrontal cortex tries to initiate, but the amygdala fires a 'threat' signal, triggering 'communication paralysis' (Spoke Metadata)."

        "text": "It's a neurobiological response, not a moral failing. ADHD brains have deficits in fronto-limbic networks, impairing the ability to disengage from negative thoughts and regulate intense emotions (Schrevel et al., 2016)."
