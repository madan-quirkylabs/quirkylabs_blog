      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Your ADHD brain is uniquely vulnerable due to differences in dopamine regulation and executive functions (like impulse control and attention switching). Modern digital platforms are specifically designed with variable reward schedules and constant novelty, which act as \"supernormal stimuli\" that can hijack your brain's natural dopamine-seeking pathways, making them highly addictive and difficult to disengage from."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Years of undiagnosed ADHD, coupled with societal misunderstandings and internalized criticism, can lead your brain to categorize your identity primarily through your struggles. This feeling is a common, neurobiologically-driven consequence of lacking a proper framework to understand your unique wiring. *Our Neuro-AI helps you shift from a deficit-based view to recognizing your whole, incredible self.*"

      "name": "Does my emotional dysregulation impact my romantic relationships?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, significantly. Emotional dysregulation in ADHD is linked to dysfunctional prefrontal cortex control over limbic (emotion) regions, particularly the amygdala. This affects impulse control in emotional and relational contexts, leading to increased conflict and difficulty managing emotions in relationships."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Why does breakup trauma hit so hard with ADHD?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The heightened emotional reactivity and memory processing issues in ADHD may cause individuals to experience severe breakups as traumatic events. This is further compounded by Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD), which causes extreme emotional pain following perceived rejection."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Absolutely not! ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition, not a character flaw. While it can present challenges in relationships, understanding these challenges and implementing strategies to address them can lead to fulfilling and loving relationships."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Stopping doom scrolling with ADHD requires strategies beyond willpower. Try implementing \"Digital Dopamine Dialâ„¢\" principles by setting clear time limits for engaging platforms, using app blockers that trigger rewards for disengagement, and substituting impulsive scrolling with pre-planned, dopamine-boosting micro-activities. Understanding the \"why\" (dopamine hit) helps you proactively create a healthier digital environment."

The goal of these hacks isn't perfect, 100% optimal productivity. The goal is to be **more effective than you were yesterday.** Forgive yourself, declare a \"brain reboot,\" and try again with the smallest possible task tomorrow."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Schedule \"priority-free zones\" into your day. This is a block of time (even just 15 minutes) where you are explicitly forbidden from thinking about your to-do list. Go for a walk, listen to music, stretch. By giving your brain a scheduled break from the \"urgency,\" you can lower your cortisol levels and come back with a slightly clearer mind."
