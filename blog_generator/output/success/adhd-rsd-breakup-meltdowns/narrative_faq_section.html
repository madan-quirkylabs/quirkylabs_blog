  <summary>Why does my breakup feel like the end of the world if I'm sensitive?</summary>
  <p>Oh, honey, you're not alone! Your sensitive brain, combined with ADHD, is a recipe for intense feelings. Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria (RSD) makes your brain interpret rejection as a threat. This can lead to a massive emotional meltdown. It's your brain's way of saying, "Danger, Will Robinson!" Pro tip: Allow yourself to feel the big feels, then gently redirect your focus to something neutral, like counting to 100.</p>

  <summary>Is it normal to feel completely devastated after a breakup when I'm sensitive?</summary>
  <p>Absolutely! It's 100% normal, especially when you're a sensitive soul navigating a breakup. Breakups are tough for everyone, but with RSD, it can feel like your entire world is crumbling.  You might feel like you're drowning in a sea of sadness, and that's okay. Just remember, you're not broken, and these feelings will pass.  Pro tip: Write down all your feelings in a journal. It's a great release.</p>

  <summary>Why am I so sensitive to *everything* after the breakup? </summary>
  <p>Your brain is on HIGH alert, friend! RSD is a real jerk, making you hyper-aware of any perceived rejection or criticism. Your amygdala (the emotional center) is working overtime. It's like your brain is constantly scanning for threats, even in the smallest comments. This heightened sensitivity is exhausting, but it will fade. Pro tip: Practice deep breathing exercises when you feel overwhelmed. It can help calm your nervous system.</p>

  <summary>How can I survive a breakup meltdown when I'm sensitive and have RSD?</summary>
  <p>First, give yourself a massive hug! Then, acknowledge those crazy feelings. Name them: "I'm feeling abandoned, rejected, and utterly devastated." Next, create a safe space.  Avoid social media, binge-watch comfort shows, and reach out to your support system. Remember, you're not alone. Pro tip:  Have a "breakup survival kit" ready with your favorite snacks, activities, and a list of people to call.</p>

  <summary>Is it just me, or does my ex's ADHD make the breakup even harder for a sensitive person?</summary>
  <p>You're not imagining things!  ADHD in a partner can definitely complicate things, especially when you're sensitive. Research (Inanc et al., Int J Psychiatry Clin Pract) shows that marital conflict and divorce rates are higher in ADHD couples.  Communication styles, emotional regulation, and different needs can clash. It's a tough combo, but you're strong. Pro tip: Focus on what *you* can control â€“ your own healing.</p>

  <summary>Why does my brain feel like a rage-filled volcano after the breakup?</summary>
  <p>RSD can trigger intense anger, and the breakup just poured gasoline on the fire!  Your brain is interpreting the rejection as a threat and your fight-or-flight response kicks in.  You might feel a surge of rage, resentment, or even a desire for revenge.  It's your brain protecting itself. Pro tip: Try physical activity, like a quick walk or dancing to your favorite music, to channel that energy.</p>

  <summary>How can I stop the breakup thoughts from replaying on repeat?</summary>
  <p>Ugh, the "breakup loop" is the worst!  Your brain is trying to make sense of what happened, which can cause the thoughts to replay.  It's like your brain is stuck on a broken record.  Try distracting yourself with activities that engage your brain, like puzzles or learning a new skill.  Pro tip:  Set a timer for 15 minutes and allow yourself to think about the breakup, then switch to something else.</p>

  <summary>Is it true that ADHD people are more likely to experience breakups? </summary>
  <p>Sadly, yes. Studies show that individuals with ADHD experience more breakups. Wymbs et al. (J Fam Psychol) found that many ADHD adults had experienced breakups. ADHD can impact communication, emotional regulation, and impulsivity, which can strain relationships. It's not a guarantee, but it's a factor. Pro tip: Focus on self-care and building a strong support system to navigate the challenges.</p>

  <summary>What's the tea on "ghosting" and how do I deal if I'm sensitive?</summary>
  <p>Ghosting?  Ugh, the ultimate breakup insult! It's when someone suddenly disappears without explanation. If you're sensitive and have RSD, ghosting can feel like a massive rejection, triggering those intense feelings.  It's incredibly hurtful and leaves you with a ton of unanswered questions.  Pro tip:  Accept that you may never get answers and focus on your own healing journey.  Don't let their actions define your worth.</p>

  <summary>So, is this RSD thing a "real" thing or am I just being dramatic? (Asking for a friend...)</summary>
  <p>Oh, honey, RSD is *absolutely* a real thing! It's not drama; it's a neurological phenomenon that can make rejection feel excruciating.  It's a common experience for people with ADHD, and it's not a sign of weakness. Your feelings are valid.  Think of it as a supercharged emotional response. Pro tip: Talk to a therapist who understands ADHD and RSD. They can provide tools and support to help you cope.</p>
