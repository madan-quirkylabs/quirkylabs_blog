## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does sensitive feel like the world is ending after a breakup?

Dude, RSD (Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria) is a real thing. Your ADHD brain's reward system goes haywire when you feel rejected. It's like your brain is screaming, 'Error! Error!' and you're left feeling totally raw. It's not you, it's your brain. Pro tip: Journal your feelings – even the messy ones – to get them out of your head.

### Is it normal to feel completely devastated after a breakup with ADHD?

Absolutely, fam! Breakups are hard for everyone, but with ADHD and RSD, it's like a super-sized dose of heartbreak. You're not alone if you feel like you're drowning in a sea of feels. Remember, your feelings are valid, even if they feel overwhelming. It's okay to cry, scream into a pillow, and eat all the ice cream. Pro tip: Give yourself permission to grieve – no shame in the game.

### How can I survive the RSD meltdowns after a breakup?

First, breathe. Then, try to identify your triggers. Is it seeing their stuff? Hearing a certain song? Avoid those like the plague (at least for now). Focus on self-care. Think: walks, fave snacks, or a good cry. Remember, it's a marathon, not a sprint. Pro tip: Create a 'calm down' kit with things that soothe you – a blanket, essential oils, a comforting book.

### Why does sensitive make me feel like I'm losing my mind after a breakup?

Your brain's dopamine pathways are all messed up right now. Rejection hits the same brain areas as physical pain. Plus, Inanc et al. showed ADHD can lead to more relationship issues. Your brain is likely stuck in a fight-or-flight mode, so it's totally normal to feel anxious, confused, and like you're spiraling. Pro tip: Try a body scan meditation to bring you back to the present moment.

### Is it just me, or does sensitive make breakups feel like a personal failure?

Nope, it's not just you, friend! RSD can make you internalize the breakup as a reflection of your worth. You might beat yourself up over every perceived flaw. Remember, breakups happen for all sorts of reasons, and it's rarely all on you. You are worthy, even if it doesn't feel like it. Pro tip: Write down all your positive qualities to combat those negative thoughts.

### How do I stop the 'what ifs' and rumination after a breakup?

Ugh, the rumination monster! It's tough, but try to catch those thoughts. When you start replaying the breakup in your head, gently redirect your focus. Try a distracting activity, like a puzzle or a video game, or chat with a friend. It's a skill, and it takes practice. Pro tip: Set a 'worry time' – 15 minutes a day where you allow yourself to overthink, then move on.

### What's the deal with RSD and breakups? Is it always this intense?

Sadly, yes, breakups can be super intense with RSD. Wymbs et al. found that people with ADHD have more breakups. It’s because RSD makes you extra sensitive to perceived rejection. It's like your brain is on high alert for threats, and a breakup feels like a massive threat to your safety. Pro tip: Remember to treat yourself with compassion, and seek professional support if it's too much.

### Can I just un-see their profile on social media after a breakup?

Okay, real talk: unfollowing and muting is a superpower! Seeing their posts can trigger those RSD feels and make you spiral. It's not about being petty; it's about protecting your mental health. It's like ripping off a band-aid, but for your brain. You got this! Pro tip: Schedule social media breaks to avoid the temptation.

### Is ghosting like, the ultimate RSD trigger?

OMG, YES! Ghosting is a total RSD nightmare. It's the ultimate rejection, and your brain doesn't get closure, leaving you to fill in the blanks with worst-case scenarios. Friedrichs et al. found that ADHD can be linked to relationship troubles. It's like a double whammy of pain. Pro tip: If you've been ghosted, remind yourself that their behavior says more about them than you.

### I'm feeling super sensitive, is it okay to reach out to my ex?

Whoa, hold up! While it’s tempting, reaching out might not be the best move right now, as it can delay your healing. It's like scratching a mosquito bite – it feels good for a sec, but then the itch comes back worse. Focus on yourself first and foremost. Pro tip: Write a letter to your ex (that you don't send) to get your feelings out.

### Is it true that sensitive can make me act 'crazy' after a breakup?

Unfortunately, yes, RSD can make you feel like you're losing it. You might say or do things you later regret because your emotions are on overdrive. It's not your fault; your brain is in survival mode. Remember, it's okay to apologize later when you are feeling better. Pro tip: Before reacting, take a deep breath and ask yourself if this is the hill you want to die on.
