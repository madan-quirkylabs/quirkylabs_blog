## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does a breakup feel like the end of the world when you're sensitive and have ADHD?

Your brain's reward system goes haywire after a breakup, especially with ADHD. You're wired to crave connection, and rejection hits like a physical blow. The amygdala, your emotional processing center, goes into overdrive. It's like a super-sized emotional meltdown. Breathe, fam. You're not alone, and it's not your fault. Action tip: Try a comforting routine like a warm bath and your fave music.

### Is it normal to feel utterly devastated after a breakup with RSD?

Absolutely. It's not just 'normal'; it's practically expected, especially if you're sensitive and have ADHD. Studies show folks with ADHD experience more breakups. Wymbs et al. (J Fam Psychol) found a higher rate of breakups in young adults with ADHD. You're not being dramatic; your brain is just extra sensitive to perceived rejection. Give yourself some grace, friend. Pro tip: Journal your feelings without judgment.

### How can I manage RSD meltdowns after a breakup when I'm super sensitive?

First, validate your feelings. Then, create a 'calm down' toolkit. This could include deep breathing exercises, a comforting playlist, or a safe person to vent to. Remember, it's okay to feel the feels. Research suggests that ADHD can contribute to relationship issues (Inanc et al., Int J Psychiatry Clin Pract). Action tip: Schedule short, frequent breaks during the day to check in with yourself.

### Why does RSD make me feel like I'm going to die after a breakup?

Your brain perceives rejection as a threat, activating the same pain pathways as physical injury. With ADHD, this is amplified. You might experience intense emotional and even physical symptoms. It’s your body's way of saying, 'Danger!' It's a primal response. Remember, you're not actually dying. Action tip: Focus on small, manageable tasks to regain a sense of control.

### Is it just me, or does every little thing feel like a HUGE deal after a breakup with RSD?

Nope, not just you! Your brain is on high alert, making every perceived slight feel monumental. Your sensitivity is heightened. You're not being 'too much'; your brain is just working overtime. Remember, Friedrichs et al. (J Affect Disord) found that ADHD is linked to relationship issues. Action tip: Try to zoom out and look at the bigger picture.

### How can I stop spiraling into a RSD meltdown after a breakup?

Grounding techniques are your best friend. When you feel the spiral starting, focus on your senses: What do you see, hear, smell, taste, and touch? Name five things you can see. Name four things you can touch. It interrupts the runaway train of thoughts. Action tip: Create a safe space where you feel secure and can retreat to when you need to decompress.

### Is it true that ADHD and breakups always lead to chaos and drama?

Absolutely not! While ADHD can present challenges in relationships, it doesn't automatically doom you to drama. Research suggests that ADHD can contribute to relationship difficulties (Inanc et al.). Recognizing your triggers and developing coping mechanisms is key. You're not a failure; you're learning. Action tip: Focus on self-compassion and celebrate your progress, no matter how small.

### What's the deal with the 'dumped and ghosted' feels after a breakup with RSD?

Ghosting hits hard, especially if you're sensitive and have ADHD! It’s the ultimate rejection, triggering those RSD feels. Your brain craves closure and validation, and ghosting denies you that. It's a confusing and painful experience. Remember, their actions reflect on them, not you. Action tip: Remind yourself of your worth and avoid the urge to reach out.

### Why does my ADHD make me hyper-fixate on the breakup and overanalyze everything?

ADHD brains love to hyper-focus, and a breakup provides endless material. You're stuck in a loop, replaying conversations and searching for answers. It's your brain's way of trying to make sense of the chaos. This can be extra hard for sensitive folks. Know that this is a common trait. Action tip: Set time limits for ruminating and then engage in a distracting activity.

### Okay, real talk: How do I 'get over it' after a breakup when I'm sensitive and have RSD?

There's no magic formula, but here's the tea: acknowledge your feelings, allow yourself to grieve, and practice self-care. This isn't a sprint; it's a marathon. Focus on building your own life and find healthy coping mechanisms. Remember, you're a work in progress! Action tip: Seek support from friends, family, or a therapist who understands ADHD and RSD.
