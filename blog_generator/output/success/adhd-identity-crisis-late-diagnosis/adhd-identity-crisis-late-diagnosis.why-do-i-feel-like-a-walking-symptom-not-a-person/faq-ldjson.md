        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Years of undiagnosed ADHD can lead to internalized shame and self-blame as you struggle with challenges that seem effortless for others. This, combined with societal misunderstandings, can lead your brain to categorize your identity primarily through your struggles and perceived deficits. It's a common, neurobiologically-driven consequence of lacking a proper framework to understand your unique wiring."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "A late diagnosis often prompts a re-evaluation of your entire life through a new lens. You may grieve for \"lost potential\" and experience a mix of relief, sorrow, and anger. It can be disorienting to realize that struggles you attributed to personal failings were actually symptoms of a neurodevelopmental condition. This can lead to feeling like you don't know who you \"really\" are anymore."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Shame is a pervasive emotion for many adults with undiagnosed or late-diagnosed ADHD. It stems from a lifetime of perceived failures, internalized criticism, and misunderstandings related to ADHD symptoms. This shame can lead to altered self-perception, emotional processing, and difficulty accepting yourself."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Early life adversity, such as child abuse or neglect, can alter the development and function of the limbic system, affecting emotion regulation and stress response. These neurobiological changes can mimic or exacerbate symptoms of ADHD, complicating diagnosis and blurring the lines between trauma and ADHD. This can further reinforce the feeling of being defined by challenges rather than strengths."
