        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "When you're constantly misunderstood, your brain starts to internalize negative labels. The prefrontal cortex seeks explanations for perceived failures and categorizes your identity through a lens of deficits, causing the amygdala to fire threat signals (Bramer, 2016). This is common with ADHD because of the lack of understanding surrounding the condition."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's not just insecurity, it's a neurobiological response. Neuroimaging studies consistently show structural and functional differences in brain regions of individuals with ADHD, particularly in the prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum (Groom & Castellanos, 2009). These differences impact attention, executive function, and motor control, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy and shame."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This isn’t laziness—it’s a neurobiological barrier. Decades of undiagnosed ADHD can lead to internalized shame and self-blame (Sussman, 2018). Your brain has created a neural pathway of self-criticism. It's not a moral failing; it's a neurodevelopmental difference."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, you're not alone. Rosén et al. (2019) found that participants experienced a mixture of relief, sorrow, and anger upon receiving an adult ADHD diagnosis, often feeling like they were a 'diagnosis' rather than a whole person. This is common with ADHD because the diagnosis reframes past experiences."
