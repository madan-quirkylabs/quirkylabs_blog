        "text": "Masking requires sustained effort to suppress natural ADHD traits, placing a continuous load on executive functions in the prefrontal cortex. Cooper et al. (2020) found this leads to cognitive fatigue and increased physiological stress responses. It's your brain working overtime to maintain a neurotypical façade."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Masking goes beyond typical social adjustments. It involves actively suppressing core ADHD symptoms like fidgeting, impulsivity, or inattentiveness, leading to a disconnect from your authentic self. Murray & Murray (2017) describe it as \"performing\" rather than being genuine, driven by fear of rejection."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This isn't laziness—it's neurobiological exhaustion. Bramer (2016) emphasizes that shame is a pervasive experience for adults with ADHD, often stemming from internalized criticism and misunderstandings. Your brain is simply wired differently, and masking is draining your resources."

It’s called masking, and it’s exhausting. It's not that I'm trying to hide from you, but it’s a learned behavior. Can you help me by creating a safe space where I don't have to constantly perform?\"*"

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It uses neuro-scaffolding to gradually reduce reliance on masking behaviors. It leverages personalized sensory cues, AI-driven narrative reframing, and micro-unmasking exercises to bypass prefrontal blockage and build self-acceptance, as well as features like a \"Texture Swap Blueprint\" and a \"Neuro-Calibrated Environment Protocol\" to eliminate sensory triggers."
