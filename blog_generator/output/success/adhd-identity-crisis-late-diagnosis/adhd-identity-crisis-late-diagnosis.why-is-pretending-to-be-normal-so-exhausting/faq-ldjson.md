        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Your ADHD brain is uniquely vulnerable due to differences in dopamine regulation and executive functions (like impulse control and attention switching). Modern digital platforms are specifically designed with variable reward schedules and constant novelty, which act as 'supernormal stimuli' that can hijack your brain's natural dopamine-seeking pathways, making them highly addictive and difficult to disengage from."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The constant effort to mask ADHD symptoms – hiding fidgeting, forcing attention, or suppressing impulsive thoughts – puts an immense, sustained load on your brain's executive functions. This \"invisible effort\" leads to profound mental and physical exhaustion, burnout, and anxiety, as your brain is constantly working against its natural wiring. *Our Neuro-AI helps you understand the neurobiological cost of masking and find sustainable paths to authenticity.*"

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, you will burn out trying to be someone you're not. Masking is a trap that leads to chronic exhaustion and a fragmented sense of self. It's not sustainable, and it's absolutely not worth your mental health. Your ADHD brain is designed for authenticity, not performance. We're here to install the right \"Operating System\" updates that empower you to gradually unmask, reclaim your energy, and thrive as your authentic, brilliant self!"

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Stopping doom scrolling with ADHD requires strategies beyond willpower. Try implementing 'Digital Dopamine Dial™' principles by setting clear time limits for engaging platforms, using app blockers that trigger rewards for disengagement, and substituting impulsive scrolling with pre-planned, dopamine-boosting micro-activities like a quick game from the QuirkyLabs OS. Understanding the 'why' (dopamine hit) helps you proactively create a healthier digital environment."

It’s called masking, and it’s draining. It's not that I'm trying to hide from you, but it’s a learned behavior. Can you help me by creating a safe space where I don't have to constantly perform?'"
