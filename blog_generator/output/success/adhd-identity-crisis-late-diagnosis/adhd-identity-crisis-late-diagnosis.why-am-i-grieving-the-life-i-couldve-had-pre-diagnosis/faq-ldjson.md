      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "When you receive a late diagnosis, your brain re-evaluates past experiences. This can trigger your prefrontal cortex to identify a gap between your perceived potential and actual outcomes, leading to a Default Mode Network (DMN) hijack and intense feelings of grief. This DMN overactivation fixates on past failures and simulates catastrophic outcomes (Spoke Pain Autopsy Details)."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This isn't just regret; it's a neurobiological response. Research shows that undiagnosed ADHD affects executive functions, making goal pursuit neurologically challenging, not a matter of willpower. \"Young et al. (2020) found that adults with ADHD exhibit impairments across all core executive functions.\" The \"missed potential\" stems from neurological differences, not a lack of trying."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Absolutely not! As Rosén et al. (2019) found, people experience a mixture of relief, sorrow, and anger upon receiving an adult ADHD diagnosis. It's a valid emotional response to years of struggling without understanding why. This isn’t self-pity; it's a crucial part of healing."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "No! This isn't about making excuses. As Groom & Castellanos (2009) explain, neuroimaging studies consistently show structural and functional differences in ADHD brains, particularly in the prefrontal cortex. You were operating with a different neurological setup."
