        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "When your prefrontal cortex tries to start a non-preferred task, dopamine pathways show reduced activity, making the effort feel huge. This triggers a \"Default Mode Network\" hijack, diverting dopamine to escapism. It's not a lack of motivation, it's dopamine dysregulation, as suggested by Groom & Castellanos (2009) in their neuroimaging review."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's not just putting things off; it's a neurobiological barrier. Young et al. (2020) found that adults with ADHD exhibit significant impairments across all core executive functions. Your brain isn't choosing to procrastinate, it's struggling with the neurochemical processes needed to initiate tasks."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Your ADHD brain is uniquely vulnerable due to differences in dopamine regulation and executive functions. Digital platforms are designed with variable reward schedules, acting as 'supernormal stimuli' that can hijack your brain's natural dopamine-seeking pathways (Illustrative Example, 2025)."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Absolutely not. As Bramer (2016) points out, shame is a pervasive emotional experience for many adults with undiagnosed ADHD. This isn't laziness—it's a neurobiological barrier. Your brain works differently, not deficiently."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, it's a common experience. Hirvikoski & Lindholm (2014) found that emotion dysregulation, including low frustration tolerance, is a significant feature of adult ADHD, impacting a large majority of individuals. This is because of dysfunction in brain regions involved in emotion processing and regulation."

Try implementing 'Digital Dopamine DialTM' principles by setting clear time limits for engaging platforms, using app blockers that trigger rewards for disengagement, and substituting impulsive scrolling with pre-planned, dopamine-boosting micro-activities like a quick game from the QuirkyLabs OS."
