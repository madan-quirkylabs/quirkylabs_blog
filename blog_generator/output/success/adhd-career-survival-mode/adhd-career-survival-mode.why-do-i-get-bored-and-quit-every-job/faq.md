### **Comprehensive FAQ: ADHD Career Survival Mode: Why You Job Hop (and How to Stop)**

#### **Category 1: Neuro-Why**
**Q: Why does job dissatisfaction feel like a constant itch I can’t scratch?**
**A:** Your ADHD brain craves novelty and stimulation due to dopamine dysregulation (Reardon, 2020). When routine sets in, your brain seeks that dopamine hit elsewhere, making job-hopping feel inevitable.

**Q: How is this different from just being indecisive or a "grass is always greener" mentality?**
**A:** It's not just indecisiveness. Shaw et al. (2014) found that ADHD is characterized by delayed cortical maturation, particularly in prefrontal regions. This makes it difficult to sustain attention on tasks that don't provide sufficient stimulation. It's a neurobiological difference, not a lack of willpower.

#### **Category 2: Shame Disruptors**
**Q: Am I a failure because I can't seem to stick with a job?**
**A:** Absolutely not. This isn't laziness—it's your brain's unique wiring. Dodd et al. (2019) show that individuals with ADHD exhibit higher entrepreneurial intentions and activity. Your need for novelty can be a strength, not a weakness. The QuirkyLabs 'Interest-Based Career Alignment Protocol' can help you channel this.

**Q: Does everyone with ADHD struggle with job hopping?**
**A:** No, but it's common. Hirvonen et al. (2019) found that higher ADHD symptom levels are associated with increased job insecurity and burnout. This highlights the importance of finding work that aligns with your brain's needs.

#### **Category 3: Practical Hacks**
**Q: What’s the first step when the urge to quit hits?**
**A:** Before you impulsively update your resume, try the '1% Rule': spend just one minute researching a new aspect of your current job. This can provide a micro-dose of novelty and redirect your focus.

**Q: How do I find engagement when I’m in ‘Spoonie Mode’ and everything feels overwhelming?**
**A:** Use the QuirkyLabs 'Good Enough' approach:
1. Identify one tiny, achievable task.
2. Pair it with a dopamine-paired reward (e.g., listen to your favorite song while you work).
3. Use a sensory cue (e.g., a specific scent or fidget toy) to help you stay focused.

#### **Category 4: Social Scripts**
**Q: How do I explain my job history to a potential employer without sounding flaky?**
**A:** *"I'm someone who thrives on new challenges and learning opportunities. While my resume may show a variety of roles, each one has given me valuable skills and experiences that I'm excited to bring to this position. I'm now looking for a place where I can apply my diverse skillset and contribute to a company long-term."*

**Q: How do I explain my ADHD-related struggles to my partner so they understand why I might be looking for a new job again?**
**A:** *"[Partner], my ADHD brain has a deep need for novelty and stimulation, and sometimes my current job feels really draining because of it. It's not about being ungrateful or disloyal; it's how my brain is wired. Can we brainstorm ways to add more 'dopamine hits' to my work, or explore career paths that better align with my need for variety?"*
