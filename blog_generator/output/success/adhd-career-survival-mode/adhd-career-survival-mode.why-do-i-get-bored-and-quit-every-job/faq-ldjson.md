        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Your ADHD brain craves novelty and stimulation due to dopamine dysregulation (Reardon, 2020). When routine sets in, your brain seeks that dopamine hit elsewhere, making job-hopping feel inevitable."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's not just indecisiveness. Shaw et al. (2014) found that ADHD is characterized by delayed cortical maturation, particularly in prefrontal regions. This makes it difficult to sustain attention on tasks that don't provide sufficient stimulation. It's a neurobiological difference, not a lack of willpower."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Absolutely not. This isn't laziness—it's your brain's unique wiring. Dodd et al. (2019) show that individuals with ADHD exhibit higher entrepreneurial intentions and activity. Your need for novelty can be a strength, not a weakness. The QuirkyLabs 'Interest-Based Career Alignment Protocol' can help you channel this."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "No, but it's common. Hirvonen et al. (2019) found that higher ADHD symptom levels are associated with increased job insecurity and burnout. This highlights the importance of finding work that aligns with your brain's needs."
