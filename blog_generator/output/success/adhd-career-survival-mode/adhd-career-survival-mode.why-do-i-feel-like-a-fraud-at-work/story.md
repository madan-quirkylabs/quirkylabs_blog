### **Why Your ADHD Brain Makes You Feel Like a Fraud at Work (And How to Reclaim Your Power)**

*"Everyone thinks I'm so capable, but they don't see the daily struggle to start simple tasks or remember deadlines. I feel like an imposter."*

ðŸ˜‚ **Cartoon Prompt**: *MidJourney: An office worker is wearing a mask labeled "Competent Professional." Sweat is dripping down their face, and the mask is slipping slightly to reveal an anxious expression underneath.*

Itâ€™s Monday morning. Youâ€™re staring at your computer, knowing you have a mountain of work to do. But instead of diving in, you find yourself alphabetizing your digital desktop files. "It's for organization," you tell yourself, a little too defensively. Then, you remember that you need to respond to that email from your bossâ€¦ but first, you *absolutely* have to check if that obscure fact you vaguely remember is actually true. Three Wikipedia rabbit holes later, you resurface, blinking in confusion. "I was being productive," you mutter, "research is part of the job!"

The clock is ticking, and a familiar feeling starts to creep in: the feeling that you're a fraud, that any minute now, someone will realize you have no idea what you're doing. You brush it aside, telling yourself you're just having an off day. "Everyone procrastinates," you reason. "It's not a big deal." But deep down, a nagging voice whispers, "They're going to find out you're not as good as they think you are."

You finally manage to open the email, but the second you read the first line, your brain short-circuits. Itâ€™s asking for a summary of last quarter's sales figures. You vaguely remember promising to get that done last week. Guilt washes over you. "I'm so unreliable," you think. "Why can't I just be normal?" You quickly scan the email for keywords, hoping to piece together what you need to do. But your eyes glaze over, and your mind wanders again.

### ðŸ§  Short Circuit: The Imposter Loop

Science TL;DR: Studies show adults with ADHD often have altered activity in brain regions linked to reward and executive control. This can lead to inconsistent performance, difficulty with planning, and a tendency to prioritize immediate gratification over long-term goals. When you struggle to meet expectations, your brain may misinterpret this as a personal failing, triggering the "imposter loop".

### ðŸ”„ NARRATIVE REPLAY â€” "Take Two"

Okay, take two. It's Monday morning, and you're staring at your computer. This time, instead of diving into the desktop organization vortex, you remember the "Not my fault" mantra. You take a deep breath and acknowledge that starting is always the hardest part.

ðŸŽ¨ **Cartoon Prompt**: *DALLÂ·E: â€˜Cartoon character high-fiving themselves after a tiny win, confetti explosion.â€™*

You open your app blocker and set a 30-minute timer for focused work. Then, you break down the email task into smaller steps: "Read email, identify key information, draft a one-sentence response." You manage to read the email and identify what needs to be done. You even draft a sentence: "I'll get those sales figures to you by Wednesday."

Progress! Exceptâ€¦ then you remember that you promised to get those figures done *last week*. The guilt starts to creep back in. You feel your focus slipping. You resist the urge to check Twitter, but instead, you find yourself researching the best way to organize your email inbox. "It's related to work," you justify. "It's still productive!"

But this time, you catch yourself. You remember the Dopamine Firewall. You close the extra tab and refocus on the task at hand. You tell yourself, "It's okay that I'm not perfect. I'm making progress." It's messy, it's imperfect, but you're moving forward.
