      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's a complex interplay of factors. Undiagnosed or unmanaged ADHD can lead to inconsistent performance due to executive dysfunction and dopamine dysregulation. Your brain, lacking a neurological explanation, internalizes these struggles as personal failings, triggering a \"Shame-Anchor Neuro-Loop.\" This loop associates success with the fear of \"being found out,\" leading to chronic self-doubt."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, very. The constant effort of masking ADHD traits and the fear of judgment contribute significantly to imposter syndrome. You may feel like you're constantly faking it, leading to anxiety and exhaustion."

      "@type": "Question",

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Masking requires immense cognitive effort, depleting your mental resources. It also prevents you from authentically expressing your strengths and needs, reinforcing the belief that your \"true\" self is inadequate."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Does my brain really *believe* I'm an imposter?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Not necessarily. Your brain is trying to make sense of inconsistent performance. The amygdala (the brain's fear center) fires \"threat\" signals when successes occur, associating them with the fear of exposure. The Default Mode Network (DMN) gets overactivated, fixating on perceived flaws and past mistakes."

      "name": "What are some common triggers for imposter syndrome at work when you have ADHD?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Triggers can be digital or analog. Digital triggers include comparison-induced dopamine crashes from LinkedIn or curated social media feeds. Analog triggers include a cluttered workspace or unfinished tasks, representing perceived personal failings. Even seemingly positive events, like receiving a promotion, can trigger the fear of being exposed."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Pay attention to micro-triggers, like a fleeting thought of a past mistake causing anxiety. Escalation involves sustained rumination on personal \"flaws,\" leading to self-sabotage and social withdrawal. A neural meltdown involves a complete shutdown of executive function and emotional regulation."

Myth: \"If you just had more self-esteem, this wouldn't be a problem.\" Neuro-Truth: Executive dysfunction isn't a moral failing; it's a breakdown in the prefrontal cortex's ability to plan and initiate. 2. Myth: \"Imposter syndrome means you're actually incompetent.\" Neuro-Truth: Imposter syndrome often stems from the internal conflict between high intelligence/potential and the genuine neurological challenges of executive function and consistency. 3. Myth: \"If you were truly good at your job, you wouldn't struggle like this.\" Neuro-Truth: Your struggles are often manifestations of ADHD symptoms amplified by neurotypical workplace structures, not a reflection of your core competence."
