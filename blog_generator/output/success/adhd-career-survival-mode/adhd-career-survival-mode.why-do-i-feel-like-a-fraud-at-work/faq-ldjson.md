        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "When you experience inconsistent performance due to ADHD, your brain can internalize these struggles as personal failings, leading to the \"Imposter Syndrome Loop.\" The amygdala fires \"threat\" signals when successes occur, associating them with the fear of \"being found out\" (Origin Story). This isn't just in your head; it's a neurobiological response."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Reardon (2020) found that individuals with ADHD exhibit altered neural activity in reward processing and executive control during decision-making. This can amplify decision fatigue and lead to analysis paralysis, making even small tasks feel overwhelming and contributing to feelings of inadequacy. This isn't just insecurity; it's a difference in how your brain processes information."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This isn’t laziness—it’s a neurobiological barrier. Your prefrontal cortex, responsible for planning and initiation, may be struggling due to executive dysfunction. Barkley (2015) emphasizes that traditional willpower-based strategies are often insufficient due to the neurobiological basis of EF deficits. Try our \"Dopamine Debug Console 2.0\" to find your specific neural roadblock."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The persistent internal feeling of being a \"fraud\" or \"imposter\" at work is a common experience for those with undiagnosed ADHD. Hirvonen et al. (2019) found that higher ADHD symptom levels were associated with increased job insecurity, job strain, and burnout. This is often due to a lifetime of masking neurodivergent traits."
