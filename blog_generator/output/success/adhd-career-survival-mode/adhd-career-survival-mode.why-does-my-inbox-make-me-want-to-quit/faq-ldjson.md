        "text": "When faced with an overflowing email inbox, the sheer volume of unread messages and diverse content triggers sensory overload and decision fatigue. This overloads the prefrontal cortex, leading to Default Mode Network hijack and task initiation paralysis (Reardon, 2020). It’s not just you; this is your brain's unique response to digital stimuli."
