      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's not laziness, it's neuroscience! For the ADHD brain, an overflowing inbox triggers sensory overload and decision fatigue. The sheer volume of unread messages overwhelms your brain's filtering systems, leading to \"Default Mode Network\" hijack – that's when your brain focuses on the *overwhelmingness* instead of the task itself."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's not just you. Email platforms are often designed to exploit ADHD vulnerabilities with constant novelty (new messages!) and subtle dopamine hits (clearing a few emails!). This creates a \"digital dopamine trap\" that makes it hard to disengage, leading to a cycle of avoidance and anxiety."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Generic advice often fails because it doesn't address the underlying *neurobiological* reasons for your struggles. It's like trying to fix a software glitch with a hammer. You need strategies that work *with* your ADHD brain, not against it."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Start with the \"1% Rule.\" Instead of aiming for inbox zero, focus on deleting *three* junk emails. Set a two-minute timer and reward yourself afterward. This gentle approach helps redirect your brain from rumination to micro-action."
