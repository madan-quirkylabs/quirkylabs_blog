## Why Your ADHD Brain Freezes Before Asking for Help at Work (And the "Courageous Communication Protocol")

*"Me: Finally ready to ask for help on this project. Also me: Suddenly deep into researching the migratory patterns of Canadian geese."*
😂 **Cartoon Prompt**: *"MidJourney: An office worker staring intently at a computer screen filled with geese, while a thought bubble shows a looming deadline."*

It’s Tuesday. Sarah’s staring at a project proposal that’s due… well, yesterday. Her brain feels like scrambled eggs. She knows she needs help. *Really* needs help. But the thought of actually *asking*? Cue the internal ice age.

*"I should be able to do this,"* Sarah thinks, the familiar wave of shame washing over her. *"Everyone else seems to manage just fine. What's wrong with me?"* She tries to push it down. *"Maybe if I just re-organize my desk… alphabetically, by color… yeah, that’ll do it."*

Two hours later, her desk is a masterpiece of chromatic order, and the proposal? Still a blank page. The self-doubt creeps in. *"They're going to think I'm incompetent. I'm going to get fired. I'm a fraud."* She brushes it aside, but the feeling lingers. *"Okay, new plan. I’ll just… quickly check LinkedIn. See what other people in similar roles are doing. For research, obviously."*

Another hour evaporates into the LinkedIn abyss. Sarah’s now comparing herself to a dozen “productivity gurus” who seem to have their entire lives perfectly curated. The shame intensifies. *"I can’t even manage a simple proposal. I'm such a failure."*

The cycle continues. Avoidance, justification, shame, rinse, and repeat. And that’s how Sarah earned a PhD in Procrastination with a minor in Desk-Organization, all while the project proposal looms like a menacing storm cloud.

### 🧠 Short Circuit: The RSD Freeze
- *"Your brain’s amygdala is stuck in 'threat' mode. Here’s the cheat code."*
- **🎨 Infographic Prompt**: *"Canva: A brain diagram, one side showing a calm prefrontal cortex, the other side showing an overactive amygdala with a flashing red 'Danger' sign."*
> Recent research indicates that individuals with ADHD are highly susceptible to Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD). This means that the fear of criticism or rejection can trigger an intense emotional response, effectively shutting down your ability to think rationally and ask for help. Think of it like your brain's alarm system being set to maximum sensitivity – even the slightest hint of potential disapproval can send you into fight-or-flight mode.

So, what’s a Sarah to do? How can she break free from this cycle of avoidance and finally get the help she needs?

#### **🎮 SOLUTION QUEST**
- **Step 1: Whisper ‘Not now, shame.’ +5 XP.** (Acknowledge the feeling, but don't let it dictate your actions.)
- **📻 Podcast Script Note**: *"Sound effect: ‘Level up’ chime after each step."*
- **Step 2: The "One-Sentence Quest." +10 XP.** Open a new email and type *one* sentence: "Hey [Colleague's Name], could you spare 15 minutes to chat about the project proposal?"
- **😂 Meme Callout**: *"Before/After: ‘Complete Proposal’ (Mount Everest) vs. ‘Open Email’ (Speed Bump)."*
- **Step 3: The "Dopamine Firewall." +15 XP.** Before you hit send, close all other distracting tabs (yes, even the Canadian geese one).
- **Step 4: The "Self-Compassion Shield." +20 XP.** While you wait for a response, do one thing that makes you feel good. Listen to your favorite song, stretch, or grab a cup of tea.
- **Step 5: The "Just Ask" Potion. +25 XP.** Even if you're still feeling anxious, hit send. You've taken a brave step, and that's something to celebrate.

It’s the next day. Sarah’s staring at a project proposal that’s still due… well, yesterday. But this time, something’s different. She remembers the "Courageous Communication Protocol."

*"Okay,"* she thinks, *"Not now, shame."* She opens a new email. But her brain throws a wrench in the gears. *"What if they say no? What if they laugh at me? What if—"*

She stops. Takes a deep breath. Remembers the "One-Sentence Quest."

*"Hey [Colleague's Name], could you spare 15 minutes to chat about the project proposal?"*

She hesitates. Her finger hovers over the send button. The anxiety is still there, a knot in her stomach. She almost chickens out. *"Maybe I can just figure it out myself…"*

But then she remembers the "Dopamine Firewall." She closes all the distracting tabs, takes another deep breath, and remembers the "Self-Compassion Shield." She puts on her headphones and listens to her favorite song.

And then, almost without thinking, she hits send.

A few minutes later, her colleague responds: "Sure, Sarah! Happy to help. How about 2 PM?"

Sarah feels a wave of relief wash over her. It wasn’t perfect. She still felt anxious. But she did it. She asked for help.

*"Huh,"* she thinks. *"That sucked slightly less. What if I tried [asking for help earlier next time]? Maybe I’m not broken—just under-resourced. Maybe."*

🌟 Imagine a week where you consistently ask for help when you need it. Now pick one to try today → **Open that email draft**, **tell shame to take a hike**, or **do that one thing that makes you feel good.**
