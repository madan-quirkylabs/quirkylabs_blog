        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Because your brain's executive function, responsible for planning and initiation, often goes on vacation for seemingly simple tasks. It's not laziness; it's a genuine neurological hurdle. Our Neuro-AI identifies your specific neural roadblock and offers a personalized bypass."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's far more complex than simple self-esteem. Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) is a common feature in ADHD, causing extreme emotional pain from perceived criticism. Years of struggling undiagnosed can also lead to internalized shame, making vulnerability feel incredibly risky."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Absolutely. Past criticism, invalidation, or feeling like a burden can create neural pathways that associate asking for help with negative emotions. Your brain may be trying to protect you from perceived threats based on those experiences."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "\"Masking,\" or hiding your ADHD traits, requires immense cognitive effort. Asking for help can feel like breaking the mask, exposing perceived flaws and increasing vulnerability to judgment."

        "text": "Start small. Use the \"1% Rule\": write just *one sentence* of an email or message asking for assistance. Set a timer for 2 minutes and reward yourself after. This helps gently redirect neural pathways from avoidance to tiny action."
