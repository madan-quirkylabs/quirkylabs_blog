      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "When you consider asking for help, your amygdala (the brain's threat center) fires a \"threat\" signal due to past perceived criticisms and the anticipation of negative judgment (RSD). This triggers a \"Default Mode Network\" hijack, diverting dopamine pathways away from proactive communication towards avoidance. This is common with ADHD because of heightened emotional reactivity and impaired top-down regulation from the prefrontal cortex (Lenzi et al., 2020)."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's not just being shy. Shaw et al. (2014) found that ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by delayed cortical maturation, particularly in prefrontal regions. This means your brain processes requests for help differently, often associating them with shame and fear, rather than problem-solving."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This is a <b>neurobiological barrier</b>, not a reflection of your abilities. Your amygdala is likely in overdrive, hijacking your prefrontal cortex and making it difficult to access your self-advocacy skills. This isn’t laziness—it’s your brain’s unique wiring. Use our \"Neuro-Communication Protocol\" to rewire this response."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This is a common struggle. Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) is prevalent in individuals with ADHD, causing extreme emotional pain in response to perceived rejection, criticism, or failure (Lenzi et al., 2020). This fear makes asking for help feel incredibly risky."
