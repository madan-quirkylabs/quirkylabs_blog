        "text": "Abu-Rustum et al. (2022) found that \"body doubling\" activates social facilitation and potentially increases dopamine release through social interaction, bypassing internal executive function deficits. The voice in your head gets blocked by the voice (or even presence) of another person. It's common with ADHD because your brain craves that external accountability and activation."

        "text": "It's not just about enjoying company; Zajonc (1965) showed that social presence can enhance performance. For ADHD, Abu-Rustum et al. (2022) showed that this external presence provides a neurobiological boost to task initiation and sustained attention that's often missing when working alone."

        "text": "This isn’t laziness—it’s a neurobiological mechanism! Your brain's executive functions need that external scaffold to get going. Abu-Rustum et al. (2022) confirms that the presence of another person activates social facilitation and provides external accountability, which can kickstart focus."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "While not everyone experiences it to the same degree, Abu-Rustum et al. (2022) highlighted the effectiveness of body doubling for many ADHD adults. This is common with ADHD because the presence of another person (even silently) provides external accountability and a sense of 'being observed,' which can activate executive functions."
