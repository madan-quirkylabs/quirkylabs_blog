### **Why Your ADHD Brain Needs a Body Double (And the Secret to Solo Focus)**

*Me: "Okay, time to write this report." Also me, 20 minutes later: "But first, let me check if my childhood pet goldfish is on Facebook."*
*ðŸŽ¨ MidJourney: â€˜Overwhelmed office worker surrounded by plushies and fidget toys, one labeled â€˜Important Thingâ„¢â€™ with a giant red arrow pointing to a Tamagotchi.â€™*

I swear, my brain has a secret agenda. It's like I'm trying to drive a car, but the steering wheel is connected to a random number generator. One minute I'm on the highway to productivity, the next I'm doing donuts in a parking lot filled with cat videos. It's especially bad when I have to work alone. The silence? Deafening. The lack of external pressure? Crippling. The sudden urge to reorganize my spice rack alphabetically by country of origin? Irresistible.

"I'll just pop into the kitchen for a glass of water," I tell myself, already knowing I'll emerge an hour later, the proud owner of a perfectly organized pantry and zero progress on that report. I mean, obviously, I *needed* to do that. The universe can't function properly with a disorganized pantry, right? And besides, those spices were practically begging for some order. It's practically self-care.

Sometimes, a little voice whispers, "Maybe you're just lazy." But I quickly shut that voice down with a mental barrage of self-justifications. Lazy? No! Efficiently distracted! Strategically procrastinating! Besides, the report will be better if I let it marinate in the back of my mind while I deep-clean my bathroom. It's all part of the creative process.

#### ðŸ”„ NARRATIVE REPLAY â€” "Take Two"
This time, I try the body double hack. I call my friend Sarah and explain my report predicament. She agrees to sit with me virtually while we both work. I announce my intention: "I'm going to write the introduction to this report."

Immediately, the urge to alphabetize my bookshelf subsides (slightly). Knowing Sarah is watching (even if she's just silently working on her own stuff) creates a subtle pressure to stay on task. I still check my phone a few times (okay, maybe more than a few), and I briefly consider Googling "how many dimples does a golf ball have?" But each time, Sarah's presence pulls me back.

I manage to write a whole paragraph! It's not perfect, and I'll probably rewrite it later, but it's progress. Then, Sarah gets a phone call, and I am on my own again. I thought that I would be able to work on my own, but I immediately got distracted and started looking up what kind of dog breeds are the most quiet. I did get to admire pictures of dogs, but the report is still lacking. I am hoping that I will be able to find a better body double strategy.

#### ðŸŒŸ GLIMPSE OF THRIVE
