### **Comprehensive FAQ: ADHD vs. Productivity Systems: Why You Keep Crashing**

#### **Category 1: Neuro-Why**

**Q: Why does needing someone else around to focus feel like I can't function on my own?**
**A:** Abu-Rustum et al. (2022) found that "body doubling" activates social facilitation and potentially increases dopamine release through social interaction, bypassing internal executive function deficits. The voice in your head gets blocked by the voice (or even presence) of another person. It's common with ADHD because your brain craves that external accountability and activation.

**Q: How is needing a "body double" different from just being a social person?**
**A:** It's not just about enjoying company; Zajonc (1965) showed that social presence can enhance performance. For ADHD, Abu-Rustum et al. (2022) showed that this external presence provides a neurobiological boost to task initiation and sustained attention that's often missing when working alone.

#### **Category 2: Shame Disruptors**

**Q: Am I lazy because I can't seem to work without someone else present?**
**A:** This isn’t laziness—it’s a neurobiological mechanism! Your brain's executive functions need that external scaffold to get going. Abu-Rustum et al. (2022) confirms that the presence of another person activates social facilitation and provides external accountability, which can kickstart focus.

**Q: Does everyone with ADHD struggle with needing external presence to focus?**
**A:** While not everyone experiences it to the same degree, Abu-Rustum et al. (2022) highlighted the effectiveness of body doubling for many ADHD adults. This is common with ADHD because the presence of another person (even silently) provides external accountability and a sense of 'being observed,' which can activate executive functions.

#### **Category 3: Practical Hacks**

**Q: What's the first step when task paralysis hits because I'm alone?**
**A:** Use the QuirkyLabs "1% Rule":

1.  **Micro-action**: Open the document or app you need to work on.
2.  **Dopamine-paired reward**: Allow yourself one minute of a preferred activity (e.g., a short song, a quick game) after opening the file.
3.  **Sensory cue**: Use a specific scent (e.g., essential oil) only when working on this type of task.

**Q: How do I ask for "body doubling" help when I'm in ‘Spoonie Mode’?**
**A:** AI-generated script: *"Hey, I'm in 'Spoonie Mode' today. Would you mind just being on a video call with me while I work? Your presence really helps my brain focus."*

#### **Category 4: Social Scripts**

**Q: How do I explain my need for "body doubling" to my partner without sounding needy?**
**A:** AI-generated script: *"[Partner], my ADHD brain sometimes needs an extra 'kickstart' to get going on tasks. Having you nearby helps me focus, not because I need you to do the work, but because your presence activates my brain in a helpful way. Can we try working in the same room sometimes?"*

#### **Category 5: Advanced Tools**

**Q: How does QuirkyLabs help me overcome the need for constant external presence to work?**
**A:** It uses neuro-scaffolding techniques to bypass prefrontal cortex blockage. Our "Temporal Anchor Protocol" and Neuro-AI predict a 70% reduction in "time warp" episodes once you understand this fundamental difference.
