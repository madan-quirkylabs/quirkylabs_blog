      "name": "Why do traditional productivity systems fail for ADHD brains?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Traditional productivity systems often rely on neurotypical executive functions like consistent planning, sustained motivation for mundane tasks, and accurate time perception. For ADHD brains, dopamine dysregulation, executive function deficits (like task initiation and working memory), and time blindness make these systems inherently challenging to consistently maintain, leading to feelings of failure and abandonment, rather than actual lack of effort. QuirkyLabs explains the neuroscience behind this mismatch and offers brain-compatible alternatives."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Individuals with ADHD are hyper-vulnerable to the persuasive, dopamine-driven design of modern technology. Features like endless scrolling, variable reward notifications, and constant novelty act as \"supernormal stimuli\" that can hijack your brain's natural dopamine-seeking pathways, making them highly addictive and difficult to disengage from."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Because your brain's executive function, responsible for planning and initiation, often goes on vacation for seemingly simple tasks. It's not laziness; it's a genuine neurological hurdle. *Our Neuro-AI identifies your specific neural roadblock and offers a personalized bypass.*"

        "@type": "Answer",

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "\"Dopamine traps\" are activities or stimuli that provide a quick and easy source of dopamine, such as social media, gaming, or online shopping. Individuals with ADHD are particularly vulnerable to these traps because their brains are already dopamine-deficient, making them more likely to seek out these quick hits of dopamine."
