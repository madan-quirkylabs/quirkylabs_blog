        "text": "Biederman & Faraone (2007) explain that ADHD brains experience a \"deficiency in the experience of gratification.\" Mundane tasks lack the stimulation needed to engage the brain, leading to task avoidance. This is common with ADHD because your brain is wired to seek novelty and interest."

        "text": "Glickman et al. (2020) found that executive function deficits, particularly in initiation and planning, are strongly correlated with procrastination in ADHD. This means procrastination is often a *symptom* of underlying executive dysfunction, not a character flaw."

        "text": "This isn’t laziness—it's a neurobiological barrier. Your dopamine pathways show reduced activity when considering mundane tasks (Biederman & Faraone, 2007). This triggers a \"Default Mode Network\" hijack, diverting energy to more stimulating distractions. Try our 'Dopamine Hacks' to rewire this."

When you see me stuck, a gentle 'neural high-five' (e.g., a specific non-verbal cue) helps me kickstart. We're working on making this brain more efficient!'\"*"
