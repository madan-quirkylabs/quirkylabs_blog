      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Your ADHD brain experiences a dopamine surge with the novelty of a new planner, promising a fresh start. However, the sustained executive functions needed for consistent use become a struggle, leading to abandonment and self-blame. This creates a predictive neural pathway where past failures reinforce the \"I can't stick to anything\" narrative, as highlighted by Murray & McCarthy (2018)."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This isn't just disorganization; it's a neurobiological mismatch. ADHD brains have deficits in time estimation and internal timing (Konrad et al., 2010), making it difficult to consistently use and maintain complex or rigid planning systems. Traditional productivity systems often rely on neurotypical executive functions (Barkley, 2015), which are fundamentally different in ADHD."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This isn't laziness—it's a neurobiological barrier. Your prefrontal cortex is struggling with the sustained executive functions required for consistent planner use. The dopamine surge from novelty wears off, and your brain seeks the next shiny object. This is common with ADHD because of impaired dopamine signaling (Volkow et al., 2011)."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, many individuals with ADHD experience this cycle. Research by Sibley et al. (2016) found that college students with ADHD reported significantly greater difficulties with organization and time management, leading to frustration and a \"graveyard\" of unused planners. You're not alone!"

When you see me stuck, a gentle 'brain fog' emoji can signal a need for external initiation support. We're working on making this brain more efficient!\"*"

Our \"Adaptive App Firewall\" also locks distracting apps during focus blocks, learning user's distraction patterns and preventing impulsive digital escapes. This provides external scaffolding to support your executive functions and help you stay on track."
