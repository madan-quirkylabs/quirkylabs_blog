      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Traditional productivity systems often rely on neurotypical executive functions like consistent planning, sustained motivation for mundane tasks, and accurate time perception. For ADHD brains, dopamine dysregulation, executive function deficits (like task initiation and working memory), and time blindness make these systems inherently challenging to consistently maintain, leading to feelings of failure and abandonment, rather than actual lack of effort. QuirkyLabs explains the neuroscience behind this mismatch and offers brain-compatible alternatives."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Individuals with ADHD are hyper-vulnerable to the persuasive, dopamine-driven design of modern technology. Features like endless scrolling, variable reward notifications, and constant novelty act as \"supernormal stimuli\" that can hijack your brain's natural dopamine-seeking pathways, making them highly addictive and difficult to disengage from."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This is a common experience called \"app cycling.\" The ADHD brain's heightened novelty-seeking and preference for immediate gratification are activated when discovering a new app, releasing a rush of dopamine. This creates a strong allure, a \"dopamine hit,\" that is preferred over the delayed rewards of sustained effort on existing systems. This impulsive acquisition is driven by the search for novel stimulation rather than genuine functional need."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "You're not alone. Impaired dopamine signaling in the brain's reward pathways makes non-inherently rewarding or novel tasks difficult to initiate and sustain. The altered functioning of the brain's reward system also contributes to heightened impulsivity and a tendency to seek immediate gratification."
