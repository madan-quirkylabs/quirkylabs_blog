      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This is often due to a Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS), common in ADHD, where your brain's natural sleep-wake cycle is shifted later. Waking before your body is ready creates physiological resistance, leading to intense fatigue and discomfort. It's not a lack of effort, but a genuine neurobiological misalignment."

      "name": "What's Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS) and why is it so common with ADHD?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "DSPS is a circadian rhythm disorder where your body's internal clock is shifted later, making it difficult to fall asleep and wake up at typical times. It's prevalent in ADHD due to dysregulation in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the brain's master clock, and altered melatonin signaling. This makes early mornings a genuine physiological struggle, not just a matter of willpower."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Why do I feel exhausted, but my brain refuses to shut off at night, leading to sleep deprivation and painful mornings?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This \"tired but wired\" phenomenon is common in ADHD. Your Default Mode Network (DMN), responsible for internal thoughts, may be overactive, preventing your brain from quieting down for sleep. Executive function challenges also make it difficult to initiate bedtime routines, further disrupting sleep."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Is my \"morning dread\" just laziness, or is there a real neurological reason behind it?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's *not* laziness! The intense discomfort of waking up with ADHD often stems from a combination of factors: a delayed circadian rhythm, chronic sleep debt, and dysregulated dopamine and norepinephrine levels. These factors create a genuine physiological resistance to awakening, making mornings a significant challenge."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Start by addressing your circadian rhythm. Use a sunrise alarm clock to gradually increase light levels before waking, consider low-dose melatonin supplementation (with medical supervision) to shift your sleep cycle, and establish a consistent sleep-wake schedule, even on weekends."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "\"Sleep scaffolding\" involves creating external cues and supports to guide you through your bedtime routine. This could include setting a visual timer for pre-sleep activities, placing your phone in another room, or using a pre-set checklist to ensure you complete each step. This offloads the burden on your executive functions and makes it easier to wind down."

        "text": "\"Dopamine snacks\" are small, enjoyable activities that provide a quick dopamine boost to motivate you to get out of bed. This could include listening to a favorite podcast, watching a short, engaging video, or enjoying a delicious cup of coffee. Pairing these activities with your morning routine can make it more appealing."

        "text": "Experiment with sensory cues that promote relaxation and alertness. This could include using a weighted blanket, adjusting the temperature in your bedroom, using essential oils with energizing scents, or taking a warm shower. Identifying and addressing your sensory sensitivities can significantly improve your morning experience."

        "@type": "Answer",

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Light therapy involves exposing yourself to bright light, typically from a special light box, for a set period each morning.
