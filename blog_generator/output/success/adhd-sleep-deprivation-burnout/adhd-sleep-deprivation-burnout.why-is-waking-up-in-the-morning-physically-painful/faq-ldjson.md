        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This isn't lazinessâ€”it's often a sign of Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS), meaning your brain's natural clock runs on a later schedule. It's a neurobiological difference, not a moral failing. According to van der Heijden et al. (2018), DSPS is highly prevalent in ADHD, making it genuinely difficult to feel sleepy at conventional bedtimes or wake up feeling refreshed."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Many do. Weaver et al. (2018) found that students with higher ADHD symptoms reported more negative affect in the mornings. This is common with ADHD because of dysregulation of circadian rhythms and dopamine pathways."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Gao et al. (2020) explain that individuals with ADHD show altered connectivity within key brain networks, including the Default Mode Network (DMN), Salience Network (SN), and Executive Control Network (ECN). This dysregulation can lead to a persistent 'on' state, preventing the brain from quieting down for sleep and making waking up difficult. It's your brain's \"Wake-Up Resistance Mode\" kicking in."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's more than just disliking mornings. With ADHD, there's often a genuine misalignment between your internal biological clock and external societal demands, as Brand et al. (2018) note. This misalignment contributes to chronic sleep debt and 'social jet lag,' leading to severe morning grogginess."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Use the QuirkyLabs protocol:\n1. **Micro-action:** The '1% Rule' - use a sunrise alarm clock at least 30 minutes before actual wake time.\n2. **Dopamine-paired reward:** Listen to a favorite podcast segment for the first 5 minutes of wakefulness.\n3. **Sensory cue:** Use a weighted blanket to provide comfort and reduce sensory defensiveness."

        "text": "It gamifies waking up by offering micro-rewards (e.g., 5 guilt-free minutes of a favorite engaging activity later) post-successful morning routine adherence, dynamically weighted by consistency and your motivational profile. This can help bypass prefrontal cortex blockage."
