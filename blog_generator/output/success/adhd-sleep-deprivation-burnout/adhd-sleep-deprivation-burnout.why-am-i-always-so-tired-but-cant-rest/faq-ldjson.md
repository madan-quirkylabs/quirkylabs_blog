      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "ADHD brains often have delayed circadian rhythms, dysregulated dopamine, and an overactive Default Mode Network (DMN), leading to a \"tired but wired\" state. Executive function challenges also make initiating bedtime routines difficult, even when drained. Think of it like a car with a revving engine and broken brakes – you're out of gas, but can't stop!"

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "\"Revenge bedtime procrastination\" is intentionally delaying sleep to reclaim personal \"me time\" after a day perceived as lacking autonomy. For ADHD, this is amplified by dopamine-seeking and difficulty transitioning away from stimulating activities, despite the cost of sleep deprivation. It's your brain rebelling against a day of demands, even if it means sacrificing precious rest."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The DMN is a network of brain regions active when you're not focused on a task – it's responsible for mind-wandering and internal thought. In ADHD, the DMN is often *overactive*, leading to racing thoughts, rumination, and difficulty \"shutting off\" the brain for sleep. It's like having a 24/7 podcast running in your head!"

      "name": "Is my 'tired but wired' feeling just anxiety, or is it something specific to ADHD?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's a combination. Anxiety certainly plays a role, but ADHD's unique neurobiology – dopamine dysregulation, DMN overactivity, and executive function challenges – make ADHD brains particularly prone to the \"tired but wired\" state. It's like pouring gasoline on an already existing fire."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "DSPS is a circadian rhythm disorder where your body's natural sleep-wake cycle is shifted later, making it difficult to fall asleep and wake up at desired times. It's common in ADHD and can exacerbate symptoms like inattention and daytime fatigue. Think of it as your internal clock being set to a different time zone."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Breaking the cycle involves understanding your ADHD brain's dopamine-driven overexertion. Implement strategic rest, realistic goal setting, leverage hyperfocus productively, and use external scaffolding (like body doubling or automated reminders) to manage energy, rather than relying on willpower alone. Think marathon, not sprint!"

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "\"Sleep scaffolding\" means building a structured, predictable routine to support your brain's transition to sleep. This includes external cues like visual timers, sensory signals (dim lights, calming scents), and consistent bedtime routines. Think of it as creating a ramp that gently guides your brain towards rest, rather than expecting it to jump off a cliff."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Use structured \"time-boxing\" to dedicate specific blocks for hyperfocus, and implement external cues for task transitions (alarms, visual reminders) to protect sleep boundaries. It's about harnessing the power of hyperfocus strategically, rather than letting it control you."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Try a \"brain dump\" (writing down all your thoughts), mindfulness exercises, listening to calming music, or engaging in a low-stimulus activity like reading. The goal is to redirect your brain's focus away from internal chatter and towards a state of calm."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Create a consistent sensory signal by using a weighted blanket, listening to white noise, dimming lights, or using a calming scent (like lavender). These cues help your brain associate specific sensations with rest, making the transition to sleep easier."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Generic sleep advice often fails ADHD brains because it relies on willpower and assumes a neurotypical brain. Focus on understanding *your* specific challenges, building external support systems (visual cues, timers), and breaking down routines into micro-steps that are easier to initiate and sustain."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Implement digital hygiene strategies like using app blockers, scheduling digital detoxes, and placing your phone in another room before bed. The goal is to reduce exposure to the variable rewards and constant novelty that fuel dopamine-seeking and disrupt sleep."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The variable reward schedules and constant novelty provided by digital platforms act as \"supernormal stimuli\" for ADHD brains seeking dopamine. This makes it difficult to disengage, even when you know it's sabotaging your sleep."
