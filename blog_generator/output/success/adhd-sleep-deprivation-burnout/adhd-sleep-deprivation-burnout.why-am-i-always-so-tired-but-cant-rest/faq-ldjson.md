        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The moment the brain attempts to downregulate for rest, the Default Mode Network (DMN), often hyperactive in ADHD, triggers a cascade of intrusive thoughts and internal chatter. This interferes with the Salience Network's ability to switch focus to internal calming cues, diverting dopamine pathways to maintain arousal instead of promoting sleep. The prefrontal cortex, already fatigued from compensatory efforts during the day, struggles to inhibit this internal noise, leading to a 'neural-lock' against rest. Gao et al. (2020) found that individuals with ADHD show altered connectivity within key brain networks, including the Default Mode Network (DMN), Salience Network (SN), and Executive Control Network (ECN)."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's more than just a preference for staying up late. Brand et al. (2018) show that ADHD brains have dysregulation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) function, leading to altered melatonin secretion patterns and a misalignment between the internal biological clock and external environmental cues. This makes it difficult to fall asleep at a reasonable time, even when exhausted, due to a genuine neurobiological difference."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This isn't laziness—it’s a neurobiological barrier. Your Default Mode Network (DMN) is likely in overdrive, preventing your brain from quieting down. Holloway et al. (2022) link perfectionism in adults with ADHD to increased stress, anxiety, and depression. The constant effort to avoid perceived flaws or criticism significantly contributes to mental and physical exhaustion. Use our \"5-Minute Brain Dump Template\" to rewire this."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, it's a common experience. Konrad et al. (2010) found that children with ADHD show altered functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network (DMN) compared to controls. This persistent DMN activity contributes to mind-wandering, racing thoughts, and difficulty with the cognitive quietude needed for sleep onset."

        "text": "Use the QuirkyLabs protocol:\n1.  **Neural Reset**: Initiate a 3-second \"Neural Reset\" by focusing on your breath, then tap your forehead lightly.\n2.  **Brain Dump**: Spend 5-10 minutes writing down all racing thoughts, worries, and tasks in a dedicated notebook.\n3.  **Sensory Signal**: Use a consistent sensory signal for sleep, like a weighted blanket or calming white noise."
