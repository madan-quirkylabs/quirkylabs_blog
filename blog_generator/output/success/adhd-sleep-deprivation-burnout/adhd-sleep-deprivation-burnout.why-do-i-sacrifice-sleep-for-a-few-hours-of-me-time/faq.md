### **Comprehensive FAQ: ADHD Sleep Sabotage: Why Your Brain Fights Rest & Fuels Burnout**

#### **Category 1: Shame Disruptors**

**Q: Am I just lazy if I can't stop scrolling and go to bed, even when I'm exhausted?**
**A:** Absolutely not! This isn't laziness; it's often "revenge bedtime procrastination," a neurobiological response to feeling a lack of autonomy during the day. Your brain is craving that 'me time' and dopamine hit (Ma et al., 2020). This is common with ADHD because of dopamine dysregulation and executive function challenges. Try our 'ADHD Sleep Saboteur Quiz' to pinpoint your specific triggers.

**Q: Does everyone with ADHD struggle with 'revenge bedtime procrastination'?**
**A:** While not everyone experiences it, many ADHD adults do (Bijlenga et al., 2019). It's linked to the need for autonomy and the difficulty transitioning away from stimulating activities. Recognize that it's not a moral failing, but a neurobiological pattern.

#### **Category 2: Neuro-Why**

**Q: Why does the urge to stay up late feel so compulsive, like a craving?**
**A:** This is your brain's reward system seeking a "release" or "dopamine hit" from unstructured, self-directed time (Mousa et al., 2023). The variable reward schedules of digital platforms act as "supernormal stimuli" for ADHD brains. It's your neurochemistry, not a lack of willpower.

**Q: How is this different from just being a night owl?**
**A:** While some people are naturally night owls, ADHD often involves a dysregulated circadian rhythm and an overactive Default Mode Network (DMN) (Brand et al., 2018; Konrad et al., 2010). This means your brain struggles to quiet down, even when your body is tired. It's more than just preference; it's a neurobiological difference.

#### **Category 3: Practical Hacks**

**Q: What's the first step when the urge to 'revenge bedtime procrastinate' hits?**
**A:** The 'Good Enough' fix is the '1% Rule': Put your phone on the charger in another room for just 15 minutes (Hallowell & Ratey, 2011). Use a haptic timer to initiate. This breaks the immediate dopamine loop.

**Q: How do I reclaim my evenings when I'm in 'Spoonie Mode'?**
**A:** Use the [QuirkyLabs protocol]:
1. Schedule a 'Dopamine Snack' - 30 minutes of guilt-free, enjoyable activity earlier in the evening.

3. Dim the lights when the timer goes off as a sensory cue.
