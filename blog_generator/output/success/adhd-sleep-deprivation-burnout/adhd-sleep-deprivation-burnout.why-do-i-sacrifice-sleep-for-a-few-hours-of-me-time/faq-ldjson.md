      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "ADHD brains often have delayed circadian rhythms, dysregulated dopamine, and an overactive Default Mode Network (DMN), leading to a 'tired but wired' state. Executive function challenges also make initiating bedtime routines difficult, even when drained."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "'Revenge bedtime procrastination' is intentionally delaying sleep to reclaim personal 'me time' after a day perceived as lacking autonomy. For ADHD, this is amplified by dopamine-seeking and difficulty transitioning away from stimulating activities, despite the cost of sleep deprivation."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The 'Boom-Buckle-Bust' cycle refers to periods of intense focus followed by exhaustion. Hyperfocus can lead to neglecting sleep, while the subsequent crash makes it harder to establish a consistent sleep routine."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Societal expectations of productivity and self-control clash with the neurobiological realities of ADHD. It's easy to internalize blame when struggling with sleep, but it's essential to remember that your brain is wired differently."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Perfectionism can drive individuals with ADHD to overwork and push themselves to exhaustion, delaying sleep to complete tasks \"perfectly.\" The fear of failure can also lead to anxiety and rumination, disrupting sleep."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) is characterized by extreme emotional pain triggered by perceived or actual criticism or rejection. The intense emotional pain and rumination associated with RSD can make it very difficult to quiet the mind for sleep."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Breaking the cycle involves understanding your ADHD brain's dopamine-driven overexertion. Implement strategic rest, realistic goal setting, leverage hyperfocus productively, and use external scaffolding (like body doubling or automated reminders) to manage energy, rather than relying on willpower alone."
