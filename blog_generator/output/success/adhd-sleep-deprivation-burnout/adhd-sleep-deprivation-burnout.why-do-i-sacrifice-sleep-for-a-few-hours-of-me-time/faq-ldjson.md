        "text": "Absolutely not! This isn't laziness; it's often \"revenge bedtime procrastination,\" a neurobiological response to feeling a lack of autonomy during the day. Your brain is craving that 'me time' and dopamine hit (Ma et al., 2020). This is common with ADHD because of dopamine dysregulation and executive function challenges. Try our 'ADHD Sleep Saboteur Quiz' to pinpoint your specific triggers."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "While not everyone experiences it, many ADHD adults do (Bijlenga et al., 2019). It's linked to the need for autonomy and the difficulty transitioning away from stimulating activities. Recognize that it's not a moral failing, but a neurobiological pattern."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This is your brain's reward system seeking a \"release\" or \"dopamine hit\" from unstructured, self-directed time (Mousa et al., 2023). The variable reward schedules of digital platforms act as \"supernormal stimuli\" for ADHD brains. It's your neurochemistry, not a lack of willpower."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "While some people are naturally night owls, ADHD often involves a dysregulated circadian rhythm and an overactive Default Mode Network (DMN) (Brand et al., 2018; Konrad et al., 2010). This means your brain struggles to quiet down, even when your body is tired. It's more than just preference; it's a neurobiological difference."

        "text": "The 'Good Enough' fix is the '1% Rule': Put your phone on the charger in another room for just 15 minutes (Hallowell & Ratey, 2011). Use a haptic timer to initiate. This breaks the immediate dopamine loop."
