      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This cycle is driven by dopamine dysregulation and executive function overload, common in ADHD. The \"Boom\" is fueled by dopamine-seeking, leading to overcommitment, while the \"Buckle\" and \"Bust\" result from depleted cognitive resources (Hallowell & Ratey, 2011)."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This isn't just about being tired; it's about a fundamental difference in how your brain regulates energy and responds to dopamine. Gao et al. (2020) found altered connectivity within key brain networks (DMN, SN, ECN) in ADHD, contributing to the inability to \"shut off.\""

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This isn't laziness—it's a neurobiological pattern. Your brain's resources are depleted due to constant compensatory efforts (Hirsch et al., 2018). It's a neurodevelopmental challenge, not a moral failing."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's a common experience, especially in demanding environments. Russell et al. (2022) found adults with ADHD reported significantly higher levels of burnout, driven by inattention and emotional dysregulation."

        "text": "It uses real-time neuro-feedback and AI-driven predictive modeling to proactively balance energy and prevent the \"Bust.\" It provides a concrete system designed for your unique brain that prevents executive function overload (Faraone et al., 2015)."
