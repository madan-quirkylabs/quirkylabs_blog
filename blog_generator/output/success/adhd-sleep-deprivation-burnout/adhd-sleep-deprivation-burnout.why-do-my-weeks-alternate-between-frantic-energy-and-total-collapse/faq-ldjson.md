      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "ADHD brains often have delayed circadian rhythms, dysregulated dopamine, and an overactive Default Mode Network (DMN), leading to a \"tired but wired\" state. Executive function challenges also make initiating bedtime routines difficult, even when drained."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "\"Revenge bedtime procrastination\" is intentionally delaying sleep to reclaim personal \"me time\" after a day perceived as lacking autonomy. For ADHD, this is amplified by dopamine-seeking and difficulty transitioning away from stimulating activities, despite the cost of sleep deprivation."

      "name": "Why do my energy levels alternate between frantic energy and total collapse with ADHD?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This is a common pattern known as the 'Boom-Buckle-Bust' cycle, driven by your ADHD brain's dopamine regulation and tendency to overexert, especially due to masking and perfectionism. It's not a personal failing, but a neurobiological challenge. *Our Neuro-AI identifies your specific neural triggers and offers a personalized energy orchestration plan.*"

      "name": "What is the 'Boom-Buckle-Bust' cycle and why does it happen to me?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The 'Boom-Buckle-Bust' cycle is a pattern of intense energy and productivity ('Boom'), followed by increased stress and difficulty managing ADHD symptoms ('Buckle'), eventually leading to profound exhaustion and collapse ('Bust'). This happens because ADHD brains often crave novelty and urgency (dopamine!), leading to overcommitment and hyperfocus until resources are depleted. Societal expectations that don't accommodate neurodivergent energy patterns also contribute."

    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Is it my fault that I can't seem to maintain consistent energy levels like other people?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Absolutely not! The 'Boom-Buckle-Bust' cycle is rooted in neurobiology, not a lack of willpower. ADHD brains have different dopamine regulation, executive function challenges, and can be more prone to sensory overload, all of which impact energy levels. It's about understanding *how* your brain works, not blaming yourself for not fitting a neurotypical mold."

      "name": "I feel like I'm constantly in \"panic mode\" to get stuff done. Why is that?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The feeling of constant panic is often linked to executive function challenges and time blindness. Your brain may struggle to prioritize tasks, leading to a sense of urgency about everything. This, combined with a fear of failure (potentially linked to Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria), can drive you into frantic 'Boom' phases, ultimately leading to burnout."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Breaking the cycle involves understanding your ADHD brain's dopamine-driven overexertion. Implement strategic rest, realistic goal setting, leverage hyperfocus productively, and use external scaffolding (like body doubling or automated reminders) to manage energy, rather than relying on willpower alone."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What are some \"strategic rest\" techniques that actually work for ADHD brains?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Strategic rest isn't just about lying down; it's about actively calming your nervous system and replenishing depleted resources. Try scheduling \"priority-free zones\" where you're forbidden from thinking about tasks, use sensory regulation techniques (like noise-canceling headphones or a weighted blanket), or engage in activities that provide gentle dopamine boosts without overstimulation (like listening to calming music or spending time in nature)."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How do I leverage hyperfocus productively without falling into the 'Boom' phase?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Time-boxing is key! Set a timer for a specific hyperfocus session, and when it goes off, *stop*, even if you're in the zone. Use that momentum for a small, non-demanding task, or a break before returning. This allows you to harness the power of hyperfocus without depleting your energy reserves."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Implement external cues for task transitions. Set alarms with specific labels (e.g., \"Bedtime Routine Starts Now!\"), use visual timers to signal the end of an activity, or ask a partner to help you transition. The key is to offload the \"stopping\" to external systems, as your brain may struggle to do it on its own."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Instead of forcing yourself to stick to rigid schedules, embrace flexibility and variety. Chunk tasks into smaller, more manageable segments, and alternate between different types of activities to keep your brain engaged. Use visual aids and gamified systems to make time management more stimulating and less of a chore."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Use analogies and visuals to illustrate the neurobiological basis of the cycle. Explain that it's not about laziness or lack of willpower, but about differences in brain function. Ask for their support in creating a more sustainable and accommodating environment, and be open to finding solutions together."
