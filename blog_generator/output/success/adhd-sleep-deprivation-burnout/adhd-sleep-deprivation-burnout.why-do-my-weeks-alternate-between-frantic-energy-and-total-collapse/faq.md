### **Comprehensive FAQ: ADHD Sleep Sabotage: Why Your Brain Fights Rest & Fuels Burnout**

#### **Category 1: Neuro-Why**
**Q: Why does the 'Boom-Buckle-Bust' cycle feel like a rollercoaster I can't control?**
**A:** This cycle is driven by dopamine dysregulation and executive function overload, common in ADHD. The "Boom" is fueled by dopamine-seeking, leading to overcommitment, while the "Buckle" and "Bust" result from depleted cognitive resources (Hallowell & Ratey, 2011).

**Q: How is this different from just being tired or having a bad week?**
**A:** This isn't just about being tired; it's about a fundamental difference in how your brain regulates energy and responds to dopamine. Gao et al. (2020) found altered connectivity within key brain networks (DMN, SN, ECN) in ADHD, contributing to the inability to "shut off."

#### **Category 2: Shame Disruptors**
**Q: Am I lazy because I can't maintain consistent energy levels and keep crashing?**
**A:** This isn't laziness—it's a neurobiological pattern. Your brain's resources are depleted due to constant compensatory efforts (Hirsch et al., 2018). It's a neurodevelopmental challenge, not a moral failing.

**Q: Does everyone with ADHD struggle with this 'Boom-Buckle-Bust' cycle?**
**A:** It's a common experience, especially in demanding environments. Russell et al. (2022) found adults with ADHD reported significantly higher levels of burnout, driven by inattention and emotional dysregulation.

#### **Category 3: Practical Hacks**
**Q: What’s the first step when I feel the 'Boom' phase ramping up?**
**A:** Implement the "1% Rule": schedule a 15-minute complete rest break with no external input. Use a 2-minute haptic timer for initiation.

**Q: How do I actually *rest* when I’m in ‘Spoonie Mode’?**
**A:** Try the QuirkyLabs "Sensory Override Protocol." Use AI-generated neuro-soundscapes to filter out distracting noise and introduce calming frequencies.

#### **Category 4: Social Scripts**
**Q: How do I explain my inconsistent energy levels to my partner?**
**A:** *"[Partner], my ADHD brain operates in a 'Boom-Buckle-Bust' cycle. It's not that I'm lazy, but that I need strategic rest to prevent burnout. Can we co-create a signal for when I need to reduce demands?"*

#### **Category 5: Advanced Tools**
**Q: How does QuirkyLabs' "Dopamine-Driven Energy Dial™" short-circuit the 'Boom-Buckle-Bust' cycle?**
**A:** It uses real-time neuro-feedback and AI-driven predictive modeling to proactively balance energy and prevent the "Bust." It provides a concrete system designed for your unique brain that prevents executive function overload (Faraone et al., 2015).
