      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "RSD is an extreme emotional pain response to perceived criticism or rejection, commonly experienced by individuals with ADHD. It's often disproportionate to the trigger and can feel like a physical attack, leading to intense sadness, anger, or social withdrawal. It is believed to be rooted in neurobiological differences in the ADHD brain's emotional processing."

      "name": "Why do minor frustrations make my ADHD brain explode?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This is a common manifestation of emotional dysregulation in ADHD. It's linked to differences in brain regions responsible for impulse control and emotional regulation (like the prefrontal cortex and amygdala). Your brain struggles to inhibit or modulate immediate, intense emotional responses to even small irritations, leading to disproportionate anger or frustration."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Can ADHD make me cry at everything?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, heightened emotional reactivity or \"emotional lability\" is common with ADHD. This can be due to rapid shifts in brain chemistry (dopamine, norepinephrine) or sensory processing sensitivity, where even minor stimuli can trigger overwhelming emotional responses, leading to frequent or intense crying spells."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Why does my brain get 'stuck' on mistakes, even when I know it's irrational?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Because your ADHD brain has difficulty with \"cognitive inhibition\"—the ability to stop or change a thought pattern. Your brain's Default Mode Network gets \"stuck\" in a replay loop, and your executive functions aren't strong enough to hit the \"stop\" button. It's a neurological glitch, not a rational choice. Our Neuro-AI identifies your specific thought-loop and offers a personalized pattern-interrupt."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Because your ADHD brain's \"error-checker\" is a relentless perfectionist with a broken off-switch. Here’s the 2-step hack to debug that shame-loop, activated by your own brain. Self-torture is not a feature. Your brain's just a different OS—and we're here to install a new firewall against your inner critic."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Try the \"3-Senses Reset.\" Name 3 things you see, 2 you hear, and 1 you feel. This forces a shift to external sensory input and momentarily disengages the Default Mode Network, interrupting the rumination cycle."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Consider a \"Scheduled Worry\" Technique. Dedicate 10 minutes to freely ruminate, followed by a structured, engaging activity to cleanly disengage. This acknowledges the urge while preventing it from hijacking your entire day."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "\"Just letting it go\" is a direct command to the executive functions that are already impaired in ADHD. It's like trying to stop a train with a piece of paper. You need a strategy to actively *redirect* attention to something more compelling."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Unlike generic advice, our \"The QuirkyLabs Emotional Thermostat Reset Method™\" uses **real-time neuro-feedback and AI-driven predictive modeling** to detect the onset of a rumination loop and deploy a \"pattern-interrupt\" *before* it takes hold, providing a concrete system designed *for your brain's unique \"stickiness.\""

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Several brain regions are involved, including the amygdala (emotional reactivity), the prefrontal cortex (emotional regulation and impulse control), and the Default Mode Network (self-referential thoughts and rumination). ADHD brains often show imbalances in these regions."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Dopamine dysregulation can contribute to heightened emotional reactivity and difficulty regulating emotional responses. It's also implicated in reward processing, so perceived rejection can feel particularly painful."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes! fMRI studies show that individuals with ADHD and high RSD exhibit unique patterns of neural activation in reward and threat processing circuits. There are also structural differences, such as a smaller pars orbitalis, linked to ADHD emotional storms."

        "@type": "Answer",

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Pattern interrupts are techniques that break the cycle of rumination or emotional escalation. They can be physical (e.g., standing up and stretching), sensory (e.g., listening to a specific song), or cognitive (e.g., using a pre-planned reframe)."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Avoid phrases like, \"Why are you still thinking about that? It happened days ago!\" This minimizes the involuntary, \"sticky\" nature of their thought process and can trigger a rejection response."
