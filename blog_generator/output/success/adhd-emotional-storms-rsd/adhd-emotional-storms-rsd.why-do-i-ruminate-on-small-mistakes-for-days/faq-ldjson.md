      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This is due to executive function deficits in cognitive inhibition and attentional control (Retz et al., 2019). Your brain's \"attentional spotlight\" gets stuck on the mistake, and the Default Mode Network (DMN) overactivates, creating a \"thought trap.\" It’s not a moral failing; it’s a glitch in your brain’s operating system."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This isn't just dwelling; it's a neurobiological response. Hirsch et al. (2022) found that ADHD brains show hyperactivity in the amygdala and hypoactivity in prefrontal control regions during emotional processing. This means your brain is wired to amplify the emotional impact of mistakes and struggle to regulate those feelings."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Absolutely not! This isn’t laziness—it’s a neurobiological barrier (Shaw et al., 2014). Rumination in ADHD stems from executive function deficits, not a lack of willpower. Your brain's prefrontal cortex is struggling to inhibit the compulsive thought loop. Try our QuirkyLabs tools to rewire this shame-anchor neuro-loop."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "While experiences vary, Rosén et al. (2018) found that emotion dysregulation is present in a substantial majority (50-70%) of adults with ADHD. This is common with ADHD because of underlying neurobiological vulnerabilities in fronto-limbic circuits."

        "text": "Use the QuirkyLabs 3-Senses Reset:\n1. Name 3 things you see.\n2. Name 2 things you hear.\n3. Name 1 thing you feel.\nThis forces a shift to external sensory input, breaking the loop."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It uses neuro-strategies to bypass brain region blockage. It actively redirects attention by labeling thoughts as 'just thoughts' and using visualization techniques to create distance. For example, it helps you engage in a complex, focus-demanding task to fully occupy the executive network."

        "text": "If rumination on a social media comment is detected, the app can be temporarily locked for a 'cool-down' period to prevent re-triggering. Weinstock, et al. (2018) highlight that emotion dysregulation requires direct intervention as part of comprehensive care."
