        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "RSD is an extreme emotional pain response to perceived criticism or rejection, commonly experienced by individuals with ADHD. It's often disproportionate to the trigger and can feel like a physical attack, leading to intense sadness, anger, or social withdrawal. It is believed to be rooted in neurobiological differences in the ADHD brain's emotional processing."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Because your ADHD brain struggles with time blindness, making the silence feel dangerously long, and working memory, which can 'forget' that the relationship is secure. This void gets filled by Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD), which defaults to a worst-case scenario: abandonment. The panic is a real neurological threat response."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "When your partner is silent, the ADHD brain's executive function deficits create a vacuum. Impaired working memory struggles to hold onto the context ('we were fine 5 minutes ago'). Time blindness distorts the duration, making a short pause feel like an eternity of abandonment. The brain, abhorring this void, fills it with worst-case scenarios fueled by RSD's intense fear of rejection. The amygdala hijacks the system, triggering a full-blown panic response to a perceived, but often non-existent, relational threat."
