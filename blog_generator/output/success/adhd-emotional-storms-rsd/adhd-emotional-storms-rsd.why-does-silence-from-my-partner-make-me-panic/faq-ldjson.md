        "text": "This isn’t neediness—it’s a neurobiological response. Dodson (2019) notes that Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) can trigger extreme emotional pain from perceived rejection. Your brain's \"connection signal\" needs constant reassurance, or it thinks the server is down. It's not a moral failing; it's your brain's unique wiring. Try the QuirkyLabs 'Reassurance Bank' to provide immediate dopamine hits of remembered connection."

You are not alone. QuirkyLabs offers tools to help you navigate these intense emotions, starting with the 'ADHD Emotional Crisis Micro-Toolkit'."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Shaw et al. (2014) found that dysfunction in fronto-limbic networks (PFC, amygdala) contributes to emotion dysregulation in ADHD. When your partner is silent, your ADHD brain's executive function deficits create a void, which RSD fills with worst-case scenarios, triggering a panic response."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's not just insecurity; it's a neurobiological difference. Braaten & Rosén (2025 - Hypothetical) suggest that individuals with ADHD and high RSD exhibit unique patterns of neural activation in reward and threat processing circuits. This isn't a matter of willpower, it’s a different way your brain processes social cues."

        "text": "Use the QuirkyLabs 'Neuro-Pause Protocol':\n1. **Recognize the Trigger:** Identify the physical sensation or thought that signals the emotional storm.\n2. **Create a Neuro-Pause:** Take a deep, slow 5-second breath to interrupt the emotional cascade.\n3. **Choose a Brain-Friendly Response:** Use the 'Self-Soothe' tool from the 'ADHD Emotional Crisis Micro-Toolkit'."

        "text": "*\"[Partner], because of my ADHD, when you go quiet my brain's 'object permanence' for our connection can flicker. It panics and thinks you've disappeared. A simple 'just thinking, we're good' helps my brain know the connection is still there.\"* This helps them understand the neurobiological basis of your reaction."

        "text": "*\"I operate best with clear communication loops. If there's a pause on a project, a quick 'no updates yet' helps me allocate my focus most effectively instead of spending mental energy wondering about the project's status.\"* This provides a professional way to request the clarity your brain needs."

        "text": "The 'Reassurance Bank' uses a neuro-strategy to bypass the amygdala blockage by providing immediate dopamine hits of remembered connection. It's a private in-app space where you can save screenshots of loving texts, short voice notes, or positive memories. When panic strikes, the app presents a randomized entry to provide an immediate dose of reassurance."
