        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Absolutely not. This isn’t a moral failing, it's a neurobiological reality. Your prefrontal cortex, responsible for impulse control, struggles to regulate the emotional signals from your amygdala (Hirsch et al., 2022). It's a regulatory glitch, not a character flaw. Try our \"Emotional Thermostat Reset Method™\" to rewire this response."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's very common. Studies show that emotional dysregulation, including intense reactions to frustration, is a significant feature of ADHD (Shaw et al., 2014). It's not \"all in your head\" – it's how your brain is wired."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This may be Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD), characterized by extreme emotional pain triggered by perceived rejection or criticism (Dodson, 2019). In ADHD, this is thought to involve dysregulation of dopamine and norepinephrine pathways, leading to an exaggerated response."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This is due to low frustration tolerance, a core feature of emotional dysregulation in ADHD (Retz et al., 2019). The amygdala signals a threat, but the underactive prefrontal cortex fails to modulate this signal, resulting in an unbuffered, \"bottom-up\" emotional reaction."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Initiate a \"Neuro-Pause.\" Take a deep breath, mentally say \"STOP,\" or physically shift your position. This creates a micro-delay between feeling the frustration and reacting to it. You can try the \"Safe Word\" Technique: use a pre-agreed word with a partner to signal you need to disengage (Spoonie Mode)."

        "text": "It uses real-time neuro-feedback and AI-driven predictive modeling to help you recognize and channel the energy surge of frustration *before* it becomes an explosion. It's a concrete system designed *for your brain's high-speed wiring*, not just generic advice."
