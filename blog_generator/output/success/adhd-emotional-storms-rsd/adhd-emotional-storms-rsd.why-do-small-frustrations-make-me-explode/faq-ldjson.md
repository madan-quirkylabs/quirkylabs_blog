      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "RSD is an extreme emotional pain response to perceived criticism or rejection, commonly experienced by individuals with ADHD. It's often disproportionate to the trigger and can feel like a physical attack, leading to intense sadness, anger, or social withdrawal. It is believed to be rooted in neurobiological differences in the ADHD brain's emotional processing."

      "name": "Why do minor frustrations make my ADHD brain explode?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This is a common manifestation of emotional dysregulation in ADHD. It's linked to differences in brain regions responsible for impulse control and emotional regulation (like the prefrontal cortex and amygdala). Your brain struggles to inhibit or modulate immediate, intense emotional responses to even small irritations, leading to disproportionate anger or frustration."

      "name": "Can ADHD make me cry at everything?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, heightened emotional reactivity or \"emotional lability\" is common with ADHD. This can be due to rapid shifts in brain chemistry (dopamine, norepinephrine) or sensory processing sensitivity, where even minor stimuli can trigger overwhelming emotional responses, leading to frequent or intense crying spells."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The *real* question users are too ashamed to Google: Your ADHD brain's threat response is a fire alarm that goes off for a burnt piece of toast. You're not a monster. Your brain's just a different OS—and we're here to install a better cooling system."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Because your brain's 'braking system' for emotions (the prefrontal cortex) is less effective, while your 'gas pedal' (the amygdala) is extra sensitive. By the time you realize you're overreacting, the emotional impulse has already taken over. It's a neurological speed vs. control issue."
