### **Comprehensive FAQ: Is Your Brain Trapped in Emotional Overwhelm? A QuirkyLabs Guide to ADHD Emotional Storms & RSD**

#### **Category 1: Shame Disruptors**

**Q: Am I a bad person because I get so angry over small things?**
**A:** Absolutely not. This isn’t a moral failing, it's a neurobiological reality. Your prefrontal cortex, responsible for impulse control, struggles to regulate the emotional signals from your amygdala (Hirsch et al., 2022). It's a regulatory glitch, not a character flaw. Try our "Emotional Thermostat Reset Method™" to rewire this response.

**Q: Does everyone with ADHD experience these explosive reactions?**
**A:** It's very common. Studies show that emotional dysregulation, including intense reactions to frustration, is a significant feature of ADHD (Shaw et al., 2014). It's not "all in your head" – it's how your brain is wired.

#### **Category 2: Neuro-Why**

**Q: Why does a minor frustration feel like a personal attack?**
**A:** This may be Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD), characterized by extreme emotional pain triggered by perceived rejection or criticism (Dodson, 2019). In ADHD, this is thought to involve dysregulation of dopamine and norepinephrine pathways, leading to an exaggerated response.

**Q: Why does my brain go from zero to "Hulk Smash" over something tiny?**
**A:** This is due to low frustration tolerance, a core feature of emotional dysregulation in ADHD (Retz et al., 2019). The amygdala signals a threat, but the underactive prefrontal cortex fails to modulate this signal, resulting in an unbuffered, "bottom-up" emotional reaction.

#### **Category 3: Practical Hacks**

**Q: What's the first step when I feel an emotional explosion coming on?**
**A:** Initiate a "Neuro-Pause." Take a deep breath, mentally say "STOP," or physically shift your position. This creates a micro-delay between feeling the frustration and reacting to it. You can try the "Safe Word" Technique: use a pre-agreed word with a partner to signal you need to disengage (Spoonie Mode).

**Q: How can I manage these intense emotions when I'm already overwhelmed?**
**A:** Use the "Energy Redirection" Protocol: engage in a quick, physical activity like push-ups or squeezing a stress ball to channel the anger surge in a non-destructive way (Balanced Mode).

#### **Category 4: Social Scripts**

**Q: How do I explain my explosive reactions to my partner?**
**A:** "[Partner], my ADHD brain has a really short fuse for frustration. It's not about you; it's an impulse-control thing. When I say 'pause,' it means I need a moment to prevent an explosion, so we can solve the actual problem calmly."

**Q: How do I communicate this to my boss?**
**A:** "I am most effective at problem-solving when I can take a moment to step back and assess a frustrating situation before reacting. This approach allows me to channel my energy into finding a solution rather than focusing on the obstacle."

#### **Category 5: Advanced Tools**

**Q: How does QuirkyLabs' "Emotional Thermostat Reset Method™" work?**
**A:** It uses real-time neuro-feedback and AI-driven predictive modeling to help you recognize and channel the energy surge of frustration *before* it becomes an explosion. It's a concrete system designed *for your brain's high-speed wiring*, not just generic advice.

**Q: How can "Reply Roulette" help me with RSD?**
**A:** While "Reply Roulette" is not specifically designed for RSD, it gamifies communication, reducing the anxiety associated with perceived rejection in digital interactions. It can help you respond to messages without overthinking and spiraling into negative emotions.
