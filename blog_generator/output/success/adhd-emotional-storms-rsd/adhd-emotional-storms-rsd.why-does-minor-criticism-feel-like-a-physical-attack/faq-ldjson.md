      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "RSD is an extreme emotional pain response to perceived criticism or rejection, commonly experienced by individuals with ADHD. It's often disproportionate to the trigger and can feel like a physical attack, leading to intense sadness, anger, or social withdrawal. It is believed to be rooted in neurobiological differences in the ADHD brain's emotional processing."

      "name": "Why do minor frustrations make my ADHD brain explode?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This is a common manifestation of emotional dysregulation in ADHD. It's linked to differences in brain regions responsible for impulse control and emotional regulation (like the prefrontal cortex and amygdala). Your brain struggles to inhibit or modulate immediate, intense emotional responses to even small irritations, leading to disproportionate anger or frustration."

      "name": "Can ADHD make me cry at everything?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, heightened emotional reactivity or \"emotional lability\" is common with ADHD. This can be due to rapid shifts in brain chemistry (dopamine, norepinephrine) or sensory processing sensitivity, where even minor stimuli can trigger overwhelming emotional responses, leading to frequent or intense crying spells."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Why does criticism with ADHD feel like a physical punch, not just words?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Because in brains with Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD), neuroimaging shows that the signal for social rejection activates the same neural pathways as physical pain. Your brain literally processes the emotional hurt as a physical injury, making the experience intensely and genuinely painful."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Key indicators of RSD include:\n    *   Intense emotional pain following perceived criticism or rejection.\n    *   A feeling that the emotional response is disproportionate to the trigger.\n    *   Difficulty shaking off negative feelings after a perceived slight.\n    *   A history of social anxiety or avoidance due to fear of rejection.\n    *   A strong desire to please others to avoid disapproval."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Try these steps:\n    1.  **Acknowledge the Pain:** Recognize that the feeling is real and valid, even if it seems disproportionate.\n    2.  **Take a Neuro-Pause:** Use a short, intentional delay (e.g., a deep breath) to interrupt the automatic emotional cascade.\n    3.  **Engage Your Senses:** Find a surface with a distinct texture and run your fingers over it, or use a grounding scent.\n    4.  **Reframe the Situation:** Ask: What is the feedback, separate from the pain? Is there one tiny useful bit? Discard the rest."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, consider these:\n    *   **Cognitive Reframing:** Challenge negative thoughts and reinterpret the situation in a more balanced way.\n    *   **Mindfulness Meditation:** Practice being present in the moment to observe emotions without judgment.\n    *   **Self-Compassion:** Treat yourself with kindness and understanding, acknowledging that everyone makes mistakes.\n    *   **Sensory Regulation:** Use sensory tools like weighted blankets or calming scents to soothe your nervous system."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Use an analogy: \"When you give me feedback, my ADHD brain's wiring can make it feel physically painful, like a real injury. It's not that I don't want to hear it, but the 'sting' is intense. If you could soften the delivery, it helps me actually hear the words instead of just feeling the pain.\" Co-create an \"RSD alert\" signal to communicate your need for reassurance without escalating the situation."

      "name": "How can I handle feedback at work without melting down from RSD?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Try these strategies:\n    *   **Request a Feedback Sandwich:** Ask for feedback to be delivered in a positive-critique-positive format.\n    *   **Reframe Criticism as Data:** Focus on the information being conveyed rather than the perceived judgment.\n    *   **Prepare for Feedback:** Before a review, practice self-compassion mantras and cognitive reframes.\n    *   **Take Breaks:** If you feel overwhelmed, take a short break to calm your nervous system before responding."
