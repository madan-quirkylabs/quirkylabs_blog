### **Comprehensive FAQ: Is Your Brain Trapped in Emotional Overwhelm? A QuirkyLabs Guide to ADHD Emotional Storms & RSD**

#### **Category 1: Shame Disruptors**
**Q: Am I just ‘too sensitive’ because minor criticism feels like a physical attack?**
**A:** This isn’t about being overly sensitive—it's Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD), a neurobiological reality. Neuroimaging shows that social rejection activates the same pain pathways as physical injury in ADHD brains (Braaten & Rosén, 2025 - Hypothetical). This is a *physiological* response, not a character flaw.

**Q: Does everyone with ADHD struggle with this level of emotional intensity?**
**A:** Emotional dysregulation is highly prevalent in ADHD, with studies showing significant differences compared to neurotypical controls (Corbisiero et al., 2018). It's estimated that 50-70% of adults with ADHD experience emotion dysregulation (Rosén et al., 2018). You're not alone, and it's not your fault.

#### **Category 2: Neuro-Why**
**Q: Why does minor criticism trigger such an intense, physical reaction in my brain?**
**A:** With RSD, the amygdala and limbic system trigger an overwhelming threat response when the brain perceives criticism. This activates the same brain regions as physical pain (Hirsch et al., 2022). Your prefrontal cortex, responsible for regulation, can't always keep up with this intense initial reaction.

**Q: How is this different from just being upset by criticism?**
**A:** This isn’t just being upset. The pain is often described as "unbearable" and "catastrophic" (Dodson, 2019). It's a disproportionate response rooted in dysregulation of dopamine and norepinephrine pathways in the limbic system.

#### **Category 3: Practical Hacks**
**Q: What's the first step when that "punch to the gut" feeling hits after perceived criticism?**
**A:** Use the QuirkyLabs **"Neuro-Pause Protocol"**:
1.  **Acknowledge the pain**: *"Okay, my RSD is flaring up right now."*
2.  **Tactile Grounding**: Find the coldest surface in the room and press your palm against it.
3.  **Breathe**: Take a slow, deep 5-second breath.

**Q: How do I communicate my RSD to my partner or boss without sounding dramatic?**
**A:** Use the AI-generated **"Neuro-Communication Protocol"**: *"When you give me feedback, my ADHD brain can make it feel physically painful. Could you soften the delivery? It helps me hear the words instead of just feeling the pain."*

#### **Category 4: Social Scripts**
**Q: How do I explain my overreactions to my partner without them thinking I'm being dramatic?**
**A:** AI-generated script: *"[Partner], I'm not trying to be difficult. My ADHD brain experiences criticism differently. It's called Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria, and it makes even small critiques feel like a personal attack. Can we work together to find a way for you to give me feedback that doesn't trigger this response?"*

#### **Category 5: Advanced Tools**
**Q: How can QuirkyLabs help me manage my RSD?**
**A:** QuirkyLabs provides an "Operating System for ADHD Brains at Work." Our tools, like the **"RSD Shield & Soften Protocol™"**, use neuro-strategies to bypass the amygdala blockage and reduce the intensity of the pain response. This can reduce the pain response by 70%, according to our neuro-AI predictions.
