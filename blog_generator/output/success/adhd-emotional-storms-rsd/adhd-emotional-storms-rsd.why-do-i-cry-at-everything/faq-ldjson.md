        "text": "No! This isn’t a character flaw; it’s a common experience for ADHD brains. Your brain's emotional and sensory processing systems are highly interconnected and sensitive. Intense emotions—both positive and negative—can create a 'surge' that your brain's regulation system can't buffer, leading to a physical release like tears. It's an overflow, not a flaw. *Our Neuro-AI identifies your specific overwhelm threshold and offers a personalized regulation plan.*"

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Because your brain's emotional and sensory processing systems are highly interconnected and sensitive. Intense emotions—both positive and negative—can create a 'surge' that your brain's regulation system can't buffer, leading to a physical release like tears. It's an overflow, not a flaw. *Our Neuro-AI identifies your specific overwhelm threshold and offers a personalized regulation plan.* According to Hirsch et al. (2022), neuroimaging studies show differences in brain regions associated with emotion processing in ADHD, including the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, and prefrontal cortex."

      "name": "Why do minor frustrations make my ADHD brain cry?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This is a common manifestation of emotional dysregulation in ADHD. It's linked to differences in brain regions responsible for impulse control and emotional regulation (like the prefrontal cortex and amygdala). This is common with ADHD because your brain struggles to inhibit or modulate immediate, intense emotional responses to even small irritations, leading to a crying response. As Shaw et al. (2014) found, emotional dysregulation is a significant feature in ADHD, often more impairing than core symptoms."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "While highly emotional people may experience intense feelings, individuals with ADHD often experience emotional lability due to rapid shifts in brain chemistry or sensory processing sensitivity. This means even minor stimuli can trigger overwhelming emotional responses and tears. Panagiotidi et al. (2020) found that sensory processing sensitivity mediates the relationship between ADHD symptoms and emotion dysregulation."
