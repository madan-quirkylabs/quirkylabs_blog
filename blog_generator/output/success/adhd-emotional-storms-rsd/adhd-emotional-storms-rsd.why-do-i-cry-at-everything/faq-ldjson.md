      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "RSD is an extreme emotional pain response to perceived criticism or rejection, commonly experienced by individuals with ADHD. It's often disproportionate to the trigger and can feel like a physical attack, leading to intense sadness and, often, uncontrollable crying. It is believed to be rooted in neurobiological differences in the ADHD brain's emotional processing."

      "name": "Why do minor frustrations make my ADHD brain explode into tears?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This is a common manifestation of emotional dysregulation in ADHD. It's linked to differences in brain regions responsible for impulse control and emotional regulation (like the prefrontal cortex and amygdala). Your brain struggles to inhibit or modulate immediate, intense emotional responses to even small irritations, leading to tears. Sensory Processing Sensitivity can also overload the system, leading to an emotional \"spillover.\""

      "name": "Can ADHD make me cry at everything, even happy things?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, heightened emotional reactivity or \"emotional lability\" is common with ADHD. This can be due to rapid shifts in brain chemistry (dopamine, norepinephrine) or sensory processing sensitivity, where even minor stimuli can trigger overwhelming emotional responses, leading to frequent or intense crying spells. Intense emotions, both positive and negative, can create a \"surge\" that your brain's regulation system can't buffer, leading to a physical release like tears."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Why does this crying feel so out of my control, even over happy things?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Because your brain's emotional and sensory processing systems are highly interconnected and sensitive. Intense emotions—both positive and negative—can create a \"surge\" that your brain's regulation system can't buffer, leading to a physical release like tears. It's an overflow, not a flaw."

        "text": "Try the \"Neuro-Pause Protocol\": 1) **Recognize the Trigger:** Identify the initial physical sensation or thought. 2) **Create a Neuro-Pause:** Implement a short, intentional delay (deep breath, mentally say \"STOP\"). 3) **Choose a Brain-Friendly Response:** Use a self-talk reframe, engage a sensory grounding tool, or communicate a need for space."

It’s not about the specific thing, but the buildup. Giving me a quiet moment to reset helps more than asking what's wrong.\""

        "text": "If possible, proactively manage your sensory environment. If you feel overwhelmed, step away to a quiet space. If you cry in front of colleagues, briefly explain that you're experiencing sensory overload and need a moment to compose yourself.

Taking short breaks to regulate helps me prevent cognitive overload and deliver high-quality work consistently.\""
