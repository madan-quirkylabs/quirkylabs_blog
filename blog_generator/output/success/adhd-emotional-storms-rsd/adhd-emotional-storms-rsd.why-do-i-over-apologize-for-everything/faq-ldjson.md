      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "RSD is an extreme emotional pain response to perceived criticism or rejection, commonly experienced by individuals with ADHD. It's often disproportionate to the trigger and can feel like a physical attack, leading to intense sadness, anger, or social withdrawal. It is believed to be rooted in neurobiological differences in the ADHD brain's emotional processing."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This stems from RSD and emotional dysregulation. Your brain is wired to be hyper-attuned to potential social threats. Any perceived disapproval (real or imagined) triggers a powerful fear of rejection, leading to the urge to apologize as a defense mechanism. It's a pre-emptive strike to avoid the unbearable emotional pain of rejection."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Because your brain's threat-detection system (the amygdala) is on high alert due to Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria, and your impulse control (in the prefrontal cortex) is taking a nap. It's a powerful, involuntary reflex to prevent emotional pain, not a conscious choice."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Neuro-Truth: For ADHD brains, compulsive apologizing is often a trauma response to Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD). It's a desperate, pre-emptive attempt to neutralize the intense, physical-like pain of perceived rejection, driven by an overactive amygdala, not just good manners."
