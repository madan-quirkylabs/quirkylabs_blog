### **ðŸŽ¯ Why Your ADHD Brain Freezes Before Appointments (And the "Productive Pocket" Reboot)**

Include a DALLÂ·E prompt for a title image: 'Cartoon brain wearing a tiny waiting room outfit, slumped in a chair with a phone, while a clock looms overhead. Pop-art style.'

ðŸ“– RELATABLE OPENING â€” "Take One"
Me: "Okay, gotta leave for the dentist in 3 hours. Plenty of time to get some work done!"
Also me, 2 hours and 58 minutes later: "Why am I watching a documentary about the history of rubber ducks?"
ðŸ˜‚ Cartoon Prompt: MidJourney: Overwhelmed person surrounded by rubber ducks of all sizes, with a looming dentist appointment in the background.

It happens every time. I have an appointment â€“ doctor, dentist, even a lunch date â€“ looming on the horizon, and suddenly my brain decides it's time for a digital vacation. Or maybe a deep dive into obscure trivia. Anything, really, except the things I *should* be doing.

"I should write that email," I think, vaguely. But then my phone buzzes. "Just one quick peek," I tell myself. Three hours later, I'm an expert on artisanal cheese-making and my email is still unwritten.

I know I'm not alone in this. It's like my brain sees the upcoming appointment as a giant roadblock, and anything before it is justâ€¦ unusable time. It's not like I *want* to waste those hours, but the motivation just vanishes. And then the guilt kicks in, because I know I could have been productive. I could have gotten something done. But instead, I'm scrolling through endless feeds, feeling increasingly frustrated with myself.

It's probably because I'm lazy. Yeah, that must be it. Wait, no, that's not right... Everyone says I'm hard working. Maybe I'm not as smart as I thought? No, that can't be it either. I'm smart, right? Ugh, whatever. More cheese documentaries it is.

The truth is, this isn't about laziness or lack of willpower. It's about how ADHD brains perceive time and process information. According to a study by Ptacek, Weissenberger, & Braverman (2019), individuals with ADHD struggle with estimating time and monitoring its passage. That "waiting" period before an appointment becomes an abstract, unusable block of time.

Plus, procrastination in ADHD is linked to executive dysfunction and emotional dysregulation (Netzer Turgeman, R., & Pollak, Y. 2025). Our brains crave dopamine, and scrolling through social media or watching YouTube videos provides a quick, easy hit. Starting a complex task, on the other hand, requires effort and planning, which can feel overwhelming when our executive functions are already struggling.

### ðŸŽ® SOLUTION QUEST
- **Step 1: Acknowledge the "Waiting Warp."** +5 XP. The first step is recognizing that this is a common ADHD experience. Don't beat yourself up about it.
- **Step 2: Plan "Productive Pockets."** +10 XP. Instead of trying to tackle a huge project, identify small, manageable tasks you can complete in 5-10 minutes.
- **Step 3: Dopamine Pairings.** +15 XP. Link those "Productive Pockets" to something you enjoy. Listen to your favorite music while clearing out your inbox, or reward yourself with a short video after completing a task.
- **Step 4: Sensory Cues.** +20 XP. Set a visual timer or use a focus-enhancing scent like peppermint to stay on track.
- **Step 5: Forgive and Move On.** +25 XP. If you still end up getting sucked into a digital rabbit hole, don't dwell on it. Just reset and try again with the time that's left.

### ðŸ”„ NARRATIVE REPLAY â€” "Take Two"
Okay, new strategy. Dentist appointment in 3 hours. This time, I'm armed with "Productive Pockets."

I open my email and tell myself I'll just answer one email. Before I knew it, I was sucked into a thread about a problem that needed solving urgently. I got lost for about 45 minutes before I realised what was happening.
"Oh no, not again!" I said out loud.
Still, I managed to answer one email. Progress!

I decide to try the "dopamine pairing" thing and tell myself I can watch one TikTok video for every 5 minutes of work I do.
It worked! Sort of. I did manage to get some work done, but I also spent a solid 45 minutes trying to find the *perfect* TikTok video to reward myself with.

But you know what? I got more done in those three hours than I usually do. And even though it wasn't perfect, it was progress. Next time, maybe I'll try setting a timer for my "reward" time, too.
