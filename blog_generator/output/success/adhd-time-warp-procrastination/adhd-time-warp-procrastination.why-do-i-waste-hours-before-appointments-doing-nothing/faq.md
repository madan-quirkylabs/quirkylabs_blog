### **Comprehensive FAQ: ADHD Time Warp & Procrastination: Unmasking Your Brain's Digital Traps**

#### **Category 1: Neuro-Why**
**Q: Why does 'waiting mode' feel like my brain is buffering, unable to start anything useful?**
**A:** When you register a future appointment, your ADHD brain perceives the intervening time as an abstract, unusable block. Your prefrontal cortex struggles to break this down into actionable steps, leading to a dopamine deficit and making digital distractions more appealing. This is common with ADHD because of altered frontal lobe activity affecting the 'internal clock' (Ptacek et al., 2019).

**Q: How is this different from just being a procrastinator?**
**A:** Procrastination in ADHD is linked to executive dysfunction and emotional dysregulation, exacerbated by reward deficiency (dopamine dysregulation). It's not a simple lack of willpower; it's a neurobiological challenge (Netzer Turgeman & Pollak, 2025). Your brain is literally wired to seek immediate gratification, making future-oriented tasks feel less rewarding.

#### **Category 2: Shame Disruptors**
**Q: Am I lazy because I can't use the time before an appointment productively?**
**A:** This isn't laziness—it's a neurobiological barrier. Your brain's executive functions are overloaded, making task initiation difficult. The shame you feel is a 'Shame-Anchor Neuro-Loop,' not a reflection of your worth.

**Q: Does everyone with ADHD struggle with this 'waiting mode' paralysis?**
**A:** Yes, this is common with ADHD. The 'now vs. not now' time perception system categorizes all intervening time as unusable. You're not alone in this struggle!

#### **Category 3: Practical Hacks**
**Q: What's the first step when 'waiting mode' hits?**
**A:** Use the '1% Rule': Just do one tiny action. For example, put on your shoes or open one work email. Set a 1-minute haptic timer for initiation.

**Q: How do I actually *do* something when I’m in ‘Spoonie Mode’ before an appointment?**
**A:** Try the '5-Minute Productive Procrastination' hack. Find an engaging micro-task, like organizing one drawer, and set a timer. Pair it with adaptive sensory cues for engagement.

#### **Category 4: Social Scripts**
**Q: How do I explain my 'waiting mode' behavior to my partner?**
**A:** *"[Partner], my ADHD brain goes into this 'waiting mode' before appointments, making it hard to start new tasks. It helps if we have a couple of quick, easy things we can do together in that time."*
