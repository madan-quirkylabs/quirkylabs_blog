      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Your ADHD brain is highly susceptible to the dopamine-driven design of modern technology. Features like endless scrolls and variable rewards (notifications) provide constant novelty and immediate dopamine hits, which can hijack your attention and cause you to lose hours without realizing it, often feeling like a \"time warp.\""

      "name": "Why does my brain shut down before an appointment, even when I have hours to spare?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This is a common ADHD phenomenon often called \"waiting mode\" or \"pre-appointment paralysis.\" Your brain's unique time perception (\"now vs. not now\") and challenges with executive function make it incredibly difficult to start and stop tasks in the unstructured time before a scheduled event. It's a genuine neurological hurdle, not laziness."

      "name": "What is ADHD time blindness?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "ADHD time blindness is a neurobiological challenge where individuals struggle to accurately perceive, estimate, and manage time. It often feels like time \"slips away\" or only exists in \"now\" vs. \"not now,\" making planning and punctuality uniquely difficult and profoundly impacted by digital distractions."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "I feel like my phone is a black hole for my time and energy. Is this normal for ADHD?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Absolutely. The design of most apps and digital platforms is specifically engineered to capture and hold attention, and ADHD brains are often more vulnerable to these tactics. The constant stream of novelty and potential rewards can create a powerful draw, making it difficult to disengage even when you know you should be doing something else."

    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Why is waiting so hard with ADHD?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Waiting involves unstructured time, which can be particularly challenging for ADHD brains. Without clear boundaries or tasks, the brain seeks stimulation, often leading to impulsive decisions like grabbing your phone or getting lost in distractions. Plus, the anticipation of the upcoming event can create anxiety, making it even harder to focus on anything else."

    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Does ADHD make me more prone to phone addiction?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "While \"addiction\" is a strong term, ADHD brains are definitely more susceptible to problematic technology use. The dopamine reward system plays a key role, as digital devices offer a constant stream of novelty and potential rewards that can be highly reinforcing. Impulsivity and difficulty regulating emotions also contribute to this vulnerability."
