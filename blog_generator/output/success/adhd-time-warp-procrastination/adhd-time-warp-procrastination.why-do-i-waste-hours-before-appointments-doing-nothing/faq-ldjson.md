        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "When you register a future appointment, your ADHD brain perceives the intervening time as an abstract, unusable block. Your prefrontal cortex struggles to break this down into actionable steps, leading to a dopamine deficit and making digital distractions more appealing. This is common with ADHD because of altered frontal lobe activity affecting the 'internal clock' (Ptacek et al., 2019)."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Procrastination in ADHD is linked to executive dysfunction and emotional dysregulation, exacerbated by reward deficiency (dopamine dysregulation). It's not a simple lack of willpower; it's a neurobiological challenge (Netzer Turgeman & Pollak, 2025). Your brain is literally wired to seek immediate gratification, making future-oriented tasks feel less rewarding."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "This isn't laziness—it's a neurobiological barrier. Your brain's executive functions are overloaded, making task initiation difficult. The shame you feel is a 'Shame-Anchor Neuro-Loop,' not a reflection of your worth."
