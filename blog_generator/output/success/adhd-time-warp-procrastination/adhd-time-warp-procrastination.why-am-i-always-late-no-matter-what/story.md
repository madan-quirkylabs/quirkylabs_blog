### ⏰ ADHD Time Warp: Why "Just Be On Time" Feels Like Mission Impossible (And Your Brain Isn't Broken)

*Me: "Okay, gotta leave in 30 minutes." Also me: "Let's just check TikTok real quick…" 3 hours later: "Wait, is it tomorrow already?!"*

Sound familiar? You're not alone. The struggle to be on time with ADHD is *real*, and it's not about a lack of willpower. It's about how your amazing, unique brain processes time – or, more accurately, *doesn't* process it the way the neurotypical world expects.

I, Alex, am a time-traveling master. I can teleport myself from the shower to the kitchen to the front door, all while being simultaneously late. So of course, I begin "Leave for Work on Time" by checking if there are any new posts on r/ADHD. (For research.) By hour two, I've diagnosed myself with 3 new conditions and started alphabetizing my socks. Leaving for work on time remains a myth.

### 🧠 Short Circuit: The Time-Traveling Toaster

The science TL;DR: Studies show that ADHD brains have actual, measurable differences in how they perceive time. (Ptacek, Weissenberger, & Braverman, 2019). It's not that you *don't care* about being on time; it's that your brain struggles to estimate time, monitor its passage, and remember past durations. This is also linked to executive dysfunction (Willcutt et al., 2005) and dopamine dysregulation (Tripp & Wickens, 2009), making it harder to plan and stay motivated. And social media? A dopamine minefield that makes time disappear (Harwood & McLean, 2020).

### 🎮 SOLUTION QUEST

**Step 1: Whisper "Not now, phone." (+5 XP)**
Seriously, put it down. Turn off notifications. Hide the app icons. Do whatever it takes to create a digital "no-fly zone" (Andreassen et al., 2019).

**Step 2: Backwards plan, baby! (+10 XP)**
Instead of thinking, "I need to leave at 8:00," start with 8:00 and work backwards: "7:45 – shoes on, 7:30 – out the door, 7:15 – grab lunch…" (Webb et al., 2020).

**Step 3: Sensory overload (the GOOD kind). (+15 XP)**
Set multiple alarms with *different* sounds (auditory overload!), put your keys in a bright orange bowl by the door (visual cue!), and maybe even try a citrus-scented essential oil (olfactory alert!) (Cahn et al., 2017).

**Step 4: The "1% Rule." (+20 XP)**
If you're feeling overwhelmed, commit to doing *one tiny thing* to move toward your goal. Put your shoes on. Grab your keys. Just *one* step (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2018).

**Step 5: Dopamine Pairing (+25 XP)**

Pair the act of getting ready with one of your most effective personalized dopamine-triggering activities (e.g., "Pair the 15-minute 'get ready' block with a chapter of an audiobook you love.").

### 🔄 NARRATIVE REPLAY — "Take Two"

This time, I deploy the "1% Rule." I put my keys by the door... then spent 20 minutes organizing the keychains. Still progress, right? Baby steps. Or baby staggers. I deployed the "1% rule" of putting on my shoes. Then I spent 45 minutes trying to find matching socks. I was still 20 minutes late, but the anxiety was a little less.

### 🌟 GLIMPSE OF THRIVE

Imagine a week where you arrive on time (or even early!) for every meeting. No more frantic rushing, no more shame spiral. Now pick one to try today → **Turn off notifications**, **Backwards plan your morning**, or **Put your keys by the door**.

### ⚡ BONUS TIP

For the Overwhelmed: If you skipped here, just do this: Set one alarm for 15 minutes before you *actually* need to leave. When it goes off, stop what you’re doing and start getting ready.
