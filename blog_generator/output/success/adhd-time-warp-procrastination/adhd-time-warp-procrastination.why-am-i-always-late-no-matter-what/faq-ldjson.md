        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Ptacek et al. (2019) highlight that time perception impairments are fundamental to ADHD, impacting executive functions. Your brain struggles to accurately estimate time and sequence tasks, combined with a dopamine-seeking tendency for digital distractions, leading to that \"sabotaged\" feeling. It's not you—it's your neurobiology."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's not about lacking skills; it's a difference in how your brain processes time. Willcutt et al. (2005) found that ADHD brains have deficits in executive function domains like working memory and planning. This isn't a moral failing, it’s a neurobiological barrier."

        "text": "Absolutely not! This is a <b>neurobiological challenge</b>, not a character flaw. The \"Shame-Anchor Neuro-Loop ID: Lateness_Character_Flaw_002\" can make you feel like you're fundamentally flawed. However, understanding that your brain processes time differently is the first step to breaking free from this shame."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It's a very common experience. Tripp & Wickens (2009) explain that dopamine system dysfunction affects motivation and the ability to sustain effort for non-immediately rewarding tasks, making the abstract concept of future appointments less salient than immediate digital rewards."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "It locks down all non-essential apps for a 30-minute \"departure window\" before an event, learning which apps are most tempting. This prevents the \"digital time warp\" and helps you stay on track. Think of it as a bouncer for your brain, keeping the dopamine demons at bay!"
