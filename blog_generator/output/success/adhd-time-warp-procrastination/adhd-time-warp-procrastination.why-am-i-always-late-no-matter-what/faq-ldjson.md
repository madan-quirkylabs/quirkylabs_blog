        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Your ADHD brain is highly susceptible to the dopamine-driven design of modern technology. Features like endless scrolls and variable rewards (notifications) provide constant novelty and immediate dopamine hits, which can hijack your attention and cause you to lose hours without realizing it, often feeling like 'time warp'."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Chronic lateness with ADHD is not a choice or a lack of effort. It stems from a core neurobiological symptom called \"time blindness,\" which impairs your brain's ability to accurately estimate how long tasks will take. This is combined with executive function challenges in planning and getting distracted, especially by modern technology. Our Neuro-AI identifies your specific lateness profile and offers a personalized system to manage it."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Not broken, just wired differently. Time perception impairments are fundamental to ADHD and impact executive functions. You might struggle with estimating time, monitoring its passage, and recalling past durations. It's like having an internal clock that runs at a different speed than everyone else's."

      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Is my chronic lateness a sign of disrespect or selfishness?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Absolutely not. For ADHD brains, chronic lateness is a symptom of impaired time perception and executive dysfunction, not a reflection of your values or feelings for others. The internal struggle and guilt are often immense. Your brain scan shows a specific neural activity pattern linked to this!"
