      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The feeling of \"fake time\" in ADHD is a real neurobiological issue. It's caused by differences in your brain's \"internal clock,\" particularly in the prefrontal cortex and dopamine pathways. This \"time blindness\" means your subjective experience of time doesn't match objective reality—it can feel like it's speeding up, slowing down, or slipping away entirely. <em>Our Neuro-AI identifies your specific time distortion patterns and offers personalized grounding tools.</em>"

Here’s the 2-step hack to re-anchor your reality when time gets glitchy, <em>activated by your own brain</em>. Time isn't broken, your perception is just more interesting—and we're here to give you the user manual."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes. Your ADHD brain is highly susceptible to the dopamine-driven design of modern technology. Features like endless scrolls and variable rewards (notifications) provide constant novelty and immediate dopamine hits, which can hijack your attention and cause you to lose hours without realizing it, often feeling like \"time warp.\""

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Time anchors are external, tangible cues that help ground your brain in the present moment and provide a consistent sense of time's passage. These can be visual (a physical clock), auditory (a timer), tactile (a fidget), or even olfactory (a scent that changes at set intervals)."
