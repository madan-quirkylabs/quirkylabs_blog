  <summary>Why do I keep replaying the breakup in my head, sensitive or not?</summary>
  <p>Oh honey, your brain is a broken record! Your ADHD brain craves closure and certainty, and a breakup is the opposite. The default mode network goes into overdrive, replaying memories. The amygdala (emotion central) is screaming. This is especially hard for sensitive souls.  Pro tip: Write down all the "what ifs" to get them out of your head.</p>

  <summary>Is it normal for a breakup to feel like the end of the world, especially if I'm sensitive?</summary>
  <p>Absolutely! Breakups are brutal, and if you're sensitive, they can feel catastrophic.  You're not alone; it's legit grief. Your brain's reward system (dopamine!) goes haywire when love vanishes.  It's like withdrawal.  Remember, everyone grieves differently.  Pro tip: Allow yourself to feel the feels, don't judge them.</p>

  <summary>Why is it so hard to stop checking their social media after a breakup, even if I'm sensitive?</summary>
  <p>That's your brain chasing a dopamine hit, friend! It's like a slot machine.  You're hoping for a sign, a glimpse, anything!  ADHD brains are extra vulnerable to this.  It also helps you to process the information and helps you feel in control.  It makes it even harder if you are sensitive to rejection.  Pro tip: Block, unfollow, and delete.  You deserve peace, not a dopamine rollercoaster.</p>

  <summary>How can I stop spiraling into the breakup obsession cycle, given I'm sensitive?</summary>
  <p>First, be kind to yourself, you sensitive soul.  Recognize the cycle: thought, feeling, action, repeat.  Interrupt it!  Try a distraction like a walk or a hobby.  Mindfulness helps train your brain to observe thoughts without getting sucked in.  Pro tip:  Set a "worry window" – 15 minutes a day to process the thoughts, then shut it down.</p>

  <summary>Is it just me, or does ADHD make breakups feel like a total dumpster fire, especially if I'm sensitive?</summary>
  <p>Nah, you're not alone! ADHD symptoms, like impulsivity and emotional dysregulation, can make relationships tricky. Inanc et al. (2017) found higher divorce rates in couples with ADHD.  Add sensitivity to the mix, and it's a recipe for intense feelings.  Pro tip:  Focus on self-care.  You’re the main character in this story.</p>

  <summary>What's the deal with RSD and breakups, and how does it affect sensitive folks?</summary>
  <p>Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) is a real thing, and it hits *hard*.  Breakups trigger RSD, causing intense emotional pain.  It's not just sadness; it's shame, anger, and a feeling of worthlessness.  Your sensitivity cranks it up even more.  Pro tip:  Find a therapist specializing in RSD to help you navigate these feelings.</p>

  <summary>How can I forgive myself for "failing" at the relationship, especially if I'm a sensitive person?</summary>
  <p>Relationships are a dance, and sometimes the music stops.  You didn't "fail."  It ended.  ADHD can make things tougher, but you're not to blame.  Self-compassion is key.  Treat yourself like you would a friend.  Pro tip:  Write yourself a letter of forgiveness, acknowledging your feelings and celebrating your resilience.</p>

  <summary>Why does my ex seem to be moving on so easily, while I'm still a mess? (Is this even normal for someone sensitive?)</summary>
  <p>Comparison is the thief of joy, my friend! Everyone processes breakups differently.  Wymbs et al. (2018) found more breakups in ADHD folks.  Your brain might be wired differently, making it harder to let go. Their experience isn't yours.  Pro tip:  Focus on your own healing journey.  Their life is irrelevant right now, babe.</p>

  <summary>Is it true that ADHD/sensitive people are more likely to experience relationship violence, and what's the deal with that?</summary>
  <p>Unfortunately, yes. Friedrichs et al. (2018) found a link between ADHD and intimate partner violence (both as victims and perpetrators).  ADHD symptoms like impulsivity and emotional dysregulation can contribute.  If you're in a situation that feels unsafe, get help immediately.  Pro tip:  Seek professional help if you're struggling with anger or feel unsafe in your relationships.</p>

  <summary>How do I get out of this breakup obsession cycle?  Is there a life hack?</summary>
  <p>There's no magic bullet, but here's the tea:  Mindfulness, therapy, and support groups are your best friends.  Recognize your triggers and create a "coping toolbox" – activities, people, and things that bring you joy.  Pro tip: Start small.  One positive choice a day can make a world of difference. You got this!</p>

  <summary>Is it a red flag if I'm still thinking about my ex months later?  Am I just being a sensitive crybaby?</summary>
  <p>Girl, no! It's not a red flag, and you're not a crybaby. Breakup recovery takes time.  Your brain is still processing.  How long is "normal" varies wildly.  It's okay to still think about them.  It's only a problem if it's crippling you. Pro tip: If it's impacting your daily life, consider talking to a therapist or counselor.</p>
