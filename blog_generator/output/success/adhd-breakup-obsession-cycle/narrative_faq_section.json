      "question": "Why does my breakup obsession feel like the end of the world, even if I know it wasn't the best relationship?",
      "answer": "Dude, I get it. Your brain's reward system (dopamine, baby!) went haywire during the relationship. Now, the lack of that 'fix' feels like a withdrawal. ADHD brains are wired for intensity, so the loss hits *hard*. It's like your brain is screaming, 'Gimme back that sweet, sweet dopamine!' Pro tip: Focus on replacing the dopamine rush with healthier activities, like a walk in nature."

      "question": "Is it normal to replay the breakup over and over in my head, even though I'm trying to move on?",
      "answer": "Absolutely, fam! It's like your brain is a broken record. Your ADHD brain struggles with emotional regulation, so it's common to get stuck on repeat. It's your brain's way of trying to make sense of things, even if it's not helpful. You're not alone; this is super common for sensitive folks. Pro tip: Set a 'worry time' each day to process thoughts, then redirect your focus."

      "question": "How can I stop the constant urge to check my ex's social media, even though it makes me feel worse?",
      "answer": "Ugh, the social media vortex! It's a classic ADHD trap. The dopamine hit from checking is tempting, but it's poison. Try a digital detox \u2013 delete the apps, or use website blockers. This helps with impulsive behaviors. Studies show that people with ADHD have higher rates of breakup experiences. Pro tip: Replace the social media habit with a new hobby or a call with a friend."

      "question": "Why does rejection from my ex feel so much more painful than rejection from other people?",
      "answer": "That's RSD (Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria) rearing its ugly head! Your brain interprets rejection as a threat, triggering a massive emotional response. ADHD brains already experience intense emotions, so rejection feels like a gut punch. For sensitive souls, this amplifies. Pro tip: Practice self-compassion. Tell yourself you're doing your best. It's not you; it's your brain."

      "question": "Is it just me, or does my ADHD make breakups feel like a total meltdown?",
      "answer": "Nope, you're not alone, friend! ADHD and breakups are a volatile combo. Inanc et al. (2010) showed that ADHD can contribute to relationship breakdown. Your brain is wired differently, making it harder to regulate emotions and process loss. It's like your emotional thermostat is broken. Pro tip: Lean on your support system. Talk to friends, family, or a therapist."

      "question": "How can I navigate the post-breakup feels without spiraling into a total emotional rollercoaster?",
      "answer": "Okay, first, breathe. It's gonna be a bumpy ride, but you've got this! Try to create a routine and stick to it. Structure helps with the chaos. Wymbs et al. (2011) found that ADHD folks experience more breakups. Journaling can help you process those feelings. Pro tip: Schedule small, achievable tasks to give yourself a sense of accomplishment."

      "question": "Is it true that ADHD makes relationships harder to maintain?",
      "answer": "Unfortunately, yes. Friedrichs et al. (2016) showed that ADHD is linked to relationship challenges. ADHD can impact communication, emotional regulation, and impulsivity, all of which can strain relationships. It doesn't mean you're doomed, but it does mean you might need to be extra mindful. Pro tip: Consider couples therapy if you enter another relationship."

    {
      "question": "Why is it so hard to 'just move on' after a breakup when I have ADHD?",
      "answer": "Because your brain isn't built to 'just move on'! ADHD brains struggle with time blindness and emotional regulation. The intensity of the feelings and the difficulty in shifting focus make it tough. Your brain fixates on the loss. You're not lazy or weak; it's a neurobiological thing. Pro tip: Set small, achievable goals for each day to create momentum."

    {
      "question": "My brain is a total mess rn, but what's a good coping mechanism?",
      "answer": "Dude, I hear you! When the feels get overwhelming, try grounding techniques. Notice 5 things you see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you hear, 2 things you smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This helps bring you back to the present moment. It's a classic! Pro tip: Don't be afraid to seek professional help. A therapist can provide tailored strategies."

    {
      "question": "Is it true that I'm 'crazy' for still being upset about the breakup after all this time?",
      "answer": "Absolutely not! The timeline of grief is different for everyone, especially when ADHD is involved. You're not crazy. Your brain is processing things in its own time. Don't let anyone invalidate your feelings. It's okay to feel what you feel, for as long as you need to. Pro tip: Focus on self-care. Do what makes you feel good - even if it's just for a little while."
