## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does sensitive feel so intense after a breakup when you have ADHD?

Okay, first off, it's totally valid to feel like your heart's been ripped out! ADHD brains are wired to experience emotions BIGLY. Rejection, like a breakup, activates the same pain pathways as physical injury. The amygdala, your brain's emotional center, goes into overdrive. It's not you; it's your brain! Try deep breathing exercises when the wave hits. 

**Pro tip:** Name five things you can see, hear, and touch to ground yourself.

### Is it normal to be completely obsessed with my ex after a breakup if I have ADHD?

Absolutely! It's like your brain is stuck on replay, replaying every moment. ADHD can make it harder to regulate emotions, and the loss of a relationship can feel like a major disruption to your routine and dopamine supply. You're not alone; it's a common struggle. Give yourself some grace. 

**Pro tip:** Set a timer for 15 minutes of obsessive thoughts, then redirect your focus to something else.

### How can I stop constantly checking my ex's social media after a breakup?

Ugh, the social media scroll is a classic! It's like a siren song for your brain. Try a social media detox! Delete the apps, or use website blockers. Studies show that limiting access can significantly decrease anxiety. It's about creating distance. You’ve got this! 

**Pro tip:** Replace social media time with a distracting activity like listening to a podcast or playing a game.

### Why does my brain keep replaying the breakup over and over? Is this normal?

Yep, it's super normal, and it's your brain's attempt to make sense of things. ADHD brains can get stuck on loops, especially when dealing with emotional pain. You're not broken! It's your brain trying to process the loss and find closure. Think of it like your brain is a broken record. 

**Pro tip:** Journaling can help you process those thoughts and feelings, so you can get out of your own head!

### I'm feeling super sensitive after my breakup. How can I cope?

First, big hugs! It's completely understandable to be a sensitive mess right now. Breakups are hard, and ADHD can amplify those feelings. Acknowledge your emotions, and don't try to push them away. Practice self-compassion. Lean on your support system. It’s a tough spot to be in, but you can get through it. 

**Pro tip:** Schedule some time for activities that bring you joy, even if it's just for 15 minutes a day.

### Is it true that ADHD makes relationships harder and breakups more common?

Sadly, yes. Studies show that individuals with ADHD may experience higher rates of relationship conflict and breakup. Inanc et al. found that marital conflict and divorce rates were higher in couples where one partner had ADHD. It’s not a death sentence, but it means you might need extra support and strategies. 

**Pro tip:** Consider couples or individual therapy with a therapist who specializes in ADHD.

### How do I stop feeling like I'll never find love again? I'm spiraling!

Girl, I feel you! That spiral is a tough place to be. But it's a total myth that this is the end of the road. Remember, your brain is playing tricks on you. Focus on self-care and building yourself up. It's time to build a better relationship with yourself. 

**Pro tip:** Write down 3 things you like about yourself every day, and then go treat yourself!

### Why am I so triggered by everything after my breakup? Is this RSD?

It could be! Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) is a common experience for ADHD folks. It's that intense emotional pain triggered by perceived rejection or criticism. Breakups are a major trigger. Studies haven’t directly linked ADHD to breakups, but the emotional intensity experienced is part of the disorder. It's rough, but you're not alone. 

**Pro tip:** Learn some coping skills for managing RSD triggers, like mindfulness or thought challenging.

### Is it a red flag if I'm constantly texting my ex? Should I just ghost them?

Look, ghosting is usually not the move. Constant texting is often a sign of feeling intense emotions and is part of the process. Try to be mindful of your communication habits and how they affect you. Set boundaries with your ex (and yourself!). Maybe it's time to take a break from contact. 

**Pro tip:** If you need to communicate with your ex, try to arrange this to be done with a third party.

### How do I stop idealizing my ex? I'm stuck in the 'grass is greener' mindset!

That 'grass is greener' feeling is a classic post-breakup symptom. Our brains often focus on the good memories and ignore the bad. Try to remember the reasons the relationship ended. Write down the negative aspects of the relationship to balance your perspective. It's about seeing the full picture. 

**Pro tip:** List the things you didn't like about the relationship to balance your thoughts.
