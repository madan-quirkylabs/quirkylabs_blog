## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does a breakup feel like the end of the world when you're sensitive?

Hey, it's rough, right? Your brain's reward system (dopamine, hello!) gets a massive hit during a relationship. Breakups? Sudden dopamine desert. For sensitive folks, this crash is amplified. You're not overreacting; it's your brain trying to recalibrate. Pro tip: Schedule small, dopamine-boosting activities like listening to your favorite song.

### Is it normal to replay the breakup over and over in my head?

Absolutely normal, sensitive soul! Your brain is in 're-run' mode, trying to make sense of things. It's like a faulty record skipping. This is especially true if you have ADHD, where overthinking is a superpower. Be kind to yourself. Pro tip: Set a 'worry window' - 15 minutes a day to process it, then move on.

### Why can't I stop checking their social media after a breakup?

Ugh, the social media spiral. This is your brain's attempt to gather information and feel a sense of control. For sensitive people, it's like picking at a scab. The brain craves a sense of 'knowing', even if it's painful. Pro tip: Block them, mute them, or install a website blocker app. Out of sight, out of mind (eventually!).

### How can I stop feeling so sensitive about what my ex said?

I feel you. The words sting, especially when you're sensitive. Your brainâ€™s built-in negativity bias is working overtime, focusing on the hurtful things. Try this: write down those words, then reframe them with compassion. Maybe they were hurting too. Pro tip: Practice self-compassion. Treat yourself like you'd treat a friend.

### Is it just me, or does a breakup completely derail my routine?

Nope, not just you! Breakups mess with your executive function, especially if you're sensitive. ADHD brains thrive on routine, and a breakup throws that out the window. This disruption can make it harder to focus, plan, and get things done. Pro tip: Rebuild your routine, even if it's just one small thing each day, like making your bed.

### Why do I feel like I'm going through withdrawal after a breakup?

That's your brain's reward system in action! Relationships trigger dopamine and oxytocin release, creating a bond. When that ends, you experience a 'chemical' withdrawal, similar to substance withdrawal. Sensitive folks feel it more intensely. Pro tip: Replace the 'relationship fix' with healthy alternatives, like exercise or a hobby.

### How can I deal with the breakup feels when I'm sensitive and have ADHD?

Combine forces! ADHD can make the pain feel amplified. Focus on small steps. Break things down. Try this: make a list of 3 things you appreciate about yourself. Then, do one small, fun activity. You got this! Pro tip: Get your body moving. Exercise releases endorphins and helps regulate your nervous system.

### Is it true ADHD can make breakups more likely?

Sadly, yeah. Studies suggest ADHD can increase the likelihood of breakups. Inanc et al. found higher marital conflict and divorce rates in ADHD couples. Wymbs et al. showed individuals with ADHD had more breakups by early adulthood. It's not a guarantee, but it's a risk factor. Pro tip: Work on communication skills and seek relationship coaching.

### Why does my brain feel like a broken record after the breakup?

Your brain's trying to make sense of a chaotic situation. This is especially true if you're sensitive and have ADHD. The emotional pain gets stuck on repeat. It's your brain's way of trying to find closure. Pro tip: Use a 'thought journal'. Write down your repetitive thoughts to help you process them, then let them go.

### I'm feeling so sensitive and can't stop the breakup thoughts. Any tips?

Girl, I feel ya! It's rough. When the thoughts start, try to distract yourself gently. Go for a walk, listen to music, or call a friend. Don't beat yourself up for feeling, just try to redirect your focus. Pro tip: Practice mindfulness. Even 5 minutes of meditation can help ground you.

### Is it a red flag if I'm still obsessed with my ex, like, months later?

Not necessarily a red flag, but it's a sign you might need support. If you're sensitive, and have ADHD, it can take longer to process. But, if it's impacting your daily life, it's time to seek help. Pro tip: Talk to a therapist or coach. They can provide tools to help you heal and move forward.
