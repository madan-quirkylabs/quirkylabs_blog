# 📚 QuirkyLabs Landing Page Creation System (V2.5 - ADHD Optimized + Human Story Expansion)

---

# 🌟 Overall Purpose

We are **not building information pages**.  
We are building **emotional bridges** for vibrant, misunderstood minds navigating ADHD, Autism, Executive Dysfunction, and Time Blindness.

Every page must:
- Build **trust and emotional connection** first
- Offer **playfulness, vividness, and quirkiness**
- Maintain a **hopeful, uplifting tone**
- Be **SEO-optimized** naturally without robotic feeling
- Sound **wildly human**, messy, funny, warm
- **Deliver constant dopamine hits** through skimmability, playful structure, and emotional pacing

# 📊 Brand Voice and Tone

- **Voice Style:** Friendly, mischievous, empathetic, wise
- **Tone:** Playful, validating, colorful, emotional
- **Quirk Level:** Very High (readers should *smirk*, *laugh softly*, *feel hugged*)
- **Persona:** A wise, funny friend lighting the way through the maze

**Golden Rules:**
- **Overflow with vivid metaphors** (minimum 3–5)
- **Short paragraphs** (2–3 lines max)
- **Breathing space:** Insert blank lines after emotional beats and metaphors
- **Emotional validation first**, teaching second
- **Smooth metaphor transitions** (no abrupt topic jumps)
- **Mini Headings:** Insert playful mini-H3 headings (###) every 150–200 words inside Story-Based Explanation
- Sound **handwritten, not AI-generated**

**Never:**
- Dry, clinical, textbook tone
- Info dumps without feelings
- Walls of text longer than 3–4 lines

# 🕋️ Mandatory Page Structure (Fully Expanded)

## 1. 🌟 Emotional Hook (Mini Story)
- Open with a vivid, quirky mini-scene or metaphor.
- Focus on an emotional moment the reader instantly relates to.
- No definitions yet.
- Paragraphs: Max 2–3 lines. Insert blank lines for breathing space.
- End with a *hopeful invitation* to explore.

### Example:
> Imagine waking up ready to conquer the day—only to find your brain handed you a treasure map written in disappearing ink. That's Executive Dysfunction for you. Let’s decode it together.

## 2. 💡 Story-Based Explanation (Narrative Core)
- Explain **through feelings and colorful metaphors**.
- No boring definitions.
- Weave in the **primary keyword** naturally 2–3 times.
- Insert **3–5 vivid metaphors** minimum.
- Use **soft transition sentences** between scenes.
- Every 150–200 words, insert a **playful H3 heading (###)** summarizing the next emotional beat.
- Paragraphs max 2–3 lines. White space is mandatory after emotional or vivid imagery.

### Example Tone:
> ADHD feels like sprinting through a field of shiny objects—while trying to read a novel—on a trampoline—during a thunderstorm. (And somehow still surviving.)

## 3. ✅ Quirky Quick Checklist (Scannable Section)

### H2 Heading Example:
> "ADHD vs Autism: Quirky Quick Comparison Checklist"

Checklist Style:
- Use vivid emotional metaphors.
- Make readers laugh or feel "oh that's me!"
- 4–6 checklist points maximum.
- Preferably sprinkle **micro-lists** inside Story sections too, not just at the end.
- Keep each point playful and colorful.

### Example:
**Signs leaning ADHD:**
- [ ] Brain DJ switching tracks mid-song
- [ ] To-do lists multiply like rabbits

**Signs leaning Autism:**
- [ ] Crowded rooms feel like blaring sirens
- [ ] Routine changes feel like tectonic earthquakes

**Shared Challenges:**
- Emotional turbulence (even while sitting)
- Sensory meltdowns

## 4. ❓ FAQ Section (SEO + Emotional Reassurance)

### H2 Heading:
> "Frequently Asked (and Sometimes Quirky) Questions"

Format:
- Use H3 `###` headings for each question.
- 2–4 sentence playful answers.
- Sneak in **one playful, actionable tip** per answer (small wins for dopamine rewards!)
- Insert 1–2 **internal links** naturally.

### Example:
```markdown
### Can ADHD and Autism overlap?
Definitely! It's like being both the pirate and the librarian. Some days you hoist the sails; some days you alphabetize your treasures. (Curious? Dive into [our overlapping traits guide](#)!)
```

### Real FAQ Themes to Cover:
- Self-doubt ("Is it my fault?")
- Navigating daily struggles
- Diagnosis confusion
- Growth possibilities

## 5. 🚀 Soft Call to Adventure (CTA)
- Invite the reader warmly, not pushy.
- Frame action as joining a journey, not fixing themselves.
- Keep it playful, validating, hopeful.

### Example CTA:
> If your heart did a little nodding dance reading this, maybe it's time to map your universe.  
> **Take our free Self-Discovery Quiz at [quirkylabs.ai](https://quirkylabs.ai)** and start celebrating the glorious quirks of your mind.

## 6. 🔍 SEO Metadata (Front Matter for Hugo)

Add this YAML block at the very top:
```yaml
---
title: "Catchy Page Title (include primary keyword)"
description: "Vivid, hopeful meta description with keyword."
slug: "url-slug-here"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
draft: false
type: "page"
tags: ["ADHD", "Autism", "Neurodivergence"]
categories: ["ADHD Guides"]
keywords: ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"]
---
```

**SEO Notes:**
- Primary keyword naturally in first 100 words.
- Sprinkle 2–3 secondary keywords.
- Meta description must be **quirky, warm, and emotionally vivid**.

## 7. 🔗 Internal Linking
- Weave in 2–3 playful links to other pages.
- Avoid "related articles" lists. Make links feel conversational.

### Example:
> Still wondering why mornings feel like running through molasses?  
> **Check out our Time Blindness explainer here!**
