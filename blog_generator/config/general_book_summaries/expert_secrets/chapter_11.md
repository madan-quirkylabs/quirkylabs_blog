# Expert Secrets — Chapter 11: The Stack Slide

## 🎯 Core Purpose of Chapter 11:

This chapter introduces the **Stack Slide**, a powerful persuasion structure used to build overwhelming value in your offer.

Russell Brunson explains that most people underprice or undersell their product because they fail to help the audience *emotionally and logically understand* what they’re getting.

The Stack Slide fixes that by walking your audience through each part of your offer, while continuously layering perceived value.

## 🧠 Key Concepts in Chapter 11

### 1. **People Judge Value by Contrast, Not Content**

You may have built something incredible — but if people don’t understand what’s included and what each part is *worth*, they won’t buy.

The Stack Slide breaks your offer into bite-sized components, each with its own:

* Name
* Description
* Perceived value

> Then at the end, you “stack” them to show how massive the full package really is.

### 2. **The Stack Creates Momentum**

By presenting your offer in parts:

* You keep attention
* You increase perceived value
* You make the full offer feel more comprehensive and generous

Each addition makes the audience go: “Oh wow… that too?!”

### 3. **The Structure of a Stack Slide**

1. Present Component #1
2. Give it a catchy name
3. Explain what it helps with
4. Anchor its standalone value
5. Repeat for each component
6. Then stack them on one slide or section
7. Reveal the full (inflated) value
8. Then give your *actual* price — creating a contrast of 10x value

## 🧪 Implications for QuirkyLabs

### 🔹 Create a Named Stack of Your Product Components

QuirkyLabs isn’t “a productivity app.” It’s a **stacked ecosystem** of belief-shifting, behavior-supporting tools:

* **2-Minute Boss Fight Engine** — Makes starting fun

  * *(\$47 value)*
* **State Selector UX** — Choose your energy mode before the challenge

  * *(\$37 value)*
* **XP Progress Tracker** — Turns tasks into dopamine

  * *(\$67 value)*
* **Shame-Free Productivity System** — Built from behavioral science + play

  * *(\$97 value)*

Then stack:

> Total Value = \$248+ … but you get it all for just \$X/month.

The more creative and clear the naming, the stronger the stack.

### 🔹 Add a Bonus Stack

Include value-rich bonuses:

* "Onboarding Starter Quest Series"
* "Productivity Persona Quiz"
* "Playbook for Beating Task Paralysis"

Bonuses should:

* Address lingering objections
* Increase urgency to act now

### 🔹 Use Stack Slide Logic in Your Blog CTAs

You can stack even in content:

> In today’s blog, you learned the 2-minute mindset. Inside the app, you’ll get:
>
> * A built-in challenge engine
> * Animated success feedback
> * Guided quests for the next 7 days

Stacking turns your CTA from "just download it" to "look at how much you get."

## ✍️ How This Shapes QuirkyLabs Blog Content

### 1. Create a Stack Template for Long-Form Content

At the end of value-rich blog posts, do a mini-stack:

* What they learned in the post
* What tools you offer to go further
* A value estimate
* A soft CTA to try it

### 2. Name Internal Features With Care

Descriptive feature names = boring.
Stack Slide-friendly names = fun, benefit-packed, curiosity-sparking:

* "Pomodoro" → "Boss Fight Engine"
* "Analytics Dashboard" → "Progress Potion Counter"
* "Checklist" → "Tiny Triumph Log"

If the name makes you smile, the user will remember it.

### 3. Use the Stack Mentality to Increase Conversion

A landing page is more persuasive when it:

* Breaks the product into modules
* Assigns value to each
* Builds toward a final reveal

Even if your price is low, this method increases **perceived value**.

## 🧩 Summary Takeaway

> *“People don’t buy because your offer is cheap. They buy because it feels like a steal.”*

The Stack Slide creates that feeling:

* Dissect your product into irresistible chunks
* Assign believable value to each
* Build a crescendo of generosity

For QuirkyLabs, this transforms you from "fun app" into "complete productivity reboot for ADHD minds."
And that makes the price — no matter what it is — feel like an easy yes.
