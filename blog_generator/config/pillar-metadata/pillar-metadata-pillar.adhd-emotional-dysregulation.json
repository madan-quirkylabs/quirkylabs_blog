While general emotional dysregulation involves a broader difficulty in managing emotional intensity and lability across various triggers, RSD's trigger is specifically social-evaluative, and the resulting pain is often described as unbearable and disproportionate. Both stem from ADHD's neurobiology but RSD has a distinct trigger and phenomenological experience."
