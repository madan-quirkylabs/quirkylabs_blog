Dopamine-Seeking: The ADHD brain often has lower baseline dopamine and seeks stimulation; stillness can feel under-stimulating or boring. 2. Executive Function Deficits: Difficulty 'switching off' work mode or trusting your ability to re-engage after stopping makes transitions to rest hard. 3. Racing Thoughts: The Default Mode Network (DMN) can be overactive, leading to an onslaught of thoughts when not focused on an external task. 4. Internalized Criticism: A lifetime of being told (or telling yourself) that rest is 'lazy' can create intense guilt and anxiety around not being 'productive.' 5. Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD): The fear of perceived failure or judgment for not being constantly 'on' can make vulnerability of rest feel threatening."
