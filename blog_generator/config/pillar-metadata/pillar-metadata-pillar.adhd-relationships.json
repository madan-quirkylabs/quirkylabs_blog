This leads to resentment for the 'parent' partner and feelings of inadequacy or being controlled for the 'child' partner.

This neurological sensitivity can cause what appears to be an overreaction—sudden anger, deep sadness, or complete withdrawal. While these defensive reactions can *sometimes be mistaken for* narcissistic traits by an observer, the underlying mechanism is different. RSD typically stems from a deep fear of rejection and perceived failure, often accompanied by genuine remorse after an outburst, whereas Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) involves a more pervasive pattern of grandiosity, lack of empathy, and a need for admiration. Differentiating requires careful observation of broader patterns of empathy, intent, and self-awareness. If concerned, seeking professional assessment for both individuals is crucial.
