This includes things like late fees from forgotten bills, the cost of replacing lost items, money wasted on unused subscriptions or spoiled groceries, and impulse purchases regretted later. It's a result of challenges with executive functions like memory, organization, and impulse control."

Strategies include creating 'pause points' before purchasing (like a 24-hour rule), identifying your personal spending triggers, finding healthier ways to get dopamine boosts, using visual reminders of financial goals, and employing ADHD-friendly tools that help track or gamify spending management. It also involves healing financial shame so you can approach the issue with self-compassion."
