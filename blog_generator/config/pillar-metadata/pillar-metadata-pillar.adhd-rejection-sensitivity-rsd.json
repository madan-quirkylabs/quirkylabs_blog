                            "text_suggestion": "Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) in ADHD is an extreme, often unbearable emotional and physiological pain triggered by perceived or actual rejection, criticism, or failure. For 'Questioning Professionals on the Edge,' this isn't just 'being overly sensitive'; it's a profound neurobiological response. It's linked to differences in brain function, such as heightened amygdala reactivity (the brain's threat detector), reduced prefrontal cortex regulation (emotional control center), and dysregulation of neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine. This unique wiring can make social rejection activate the same brain pathways as physical pain, leading to a visceral experience of pain that can act as a 'hidden engine' for many workplace struggles."

To avoid this profound dysphoria, they may develop specific maladaptive coping behaviors – this is the 'Hidden Engine™' effect. Examples include: 1. Extreme People-Pleasing/Fawning: To prevent any possible disapproval. 2. Debilitating Perfectionism: To eliminate any chance of criticism or failure. 3. Chronic Avoidance: Sidestepping tasks, projects, or even promotions that carry a perceived risk of rejection. 4. Relationship Sabotage: Preemptively ending connections to control the inevitable pain. These behaviors, fueled by RSD, significantly impact career progression and well-being for 'The Questioning Professional on the Edge.'"
