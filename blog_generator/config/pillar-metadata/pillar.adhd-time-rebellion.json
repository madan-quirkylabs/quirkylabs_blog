It's rooted in neurobiological differences in brain structure and function (e.g., prefrontal cortex, dopamine regulation, interest-based nervous system), not a lack of effort, character, or discipline. Unlike laziness, people with time blindness often genuinely intend to be on time or meet deadlines but their internal 'clock' is unreliable."
