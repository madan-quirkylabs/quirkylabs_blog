                            "text": "If you have or suspect you have ADHD, feeling like an impostor at work is common and directly linked to neurobiology. Executive function challenges can lead to inconsistent performance, making successes feel unearned or like 'luck.' Dopamine differences can affect how you internalize rewards and achievements. Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) can intensify fear of criticism, leading to perfectionism and masking (hiding struggles). This constant effort to appear 'neurotypical' is exhausting and makes you feel inauthentic and like a fraud, even when you are objectively competent and successful."

                            "text": "While many people experience self-doubt, ADHD-related impostor syndrome is uniquely amplified by the specific challenges of ADHD. It's not just about lacking confidence; it's about the lived experience of inconsistent focus, time blindness causing deadline rushes, emotional dysregulation (like RSD making minor feedback feel catastrophic), and the profound mental effort of 'masking' to hide these neurobiological differences. Generic advice often fails because it doesn't address these ADHD-specific root causes, leading to a deeper sense of being flawed when those strategies don't work."

                            "text": "Effective solutions for ADHD impostor syndrome are ADHD-centric, meaning they are designed *for* the ADHD brain. This includes strategies that help you: 1. Understand and manage RSD triggers that fuel impostor thoughts. 2. Build self-worth based on effort, learning, and unique ADHD strengths, despite inconsistent output. 3. Develop authenticity by understanding and working *with* your ADHD traits (like leveraging hyperfocus or creativity) rather than solely trying to suppress them. 4. Utilize ADHD-friendly planning, organization, and productivity systems that accommodate executive function differences. Gamified approaches and tools that provide immediate feedback and novelty can be particularly helpful."
