Your brain has critical demands for stimulation (especially dopamine) and sensory input. Restlessness, fidgeting (your body's 'Dopamine Morse Code™'), and even energy fluctuations can be your body's way of trying to meet these demands or signal dysregulation (like an offline 'Interoceptive Compass™'). It's not intentional sabotage but a complex interplay of your nervous system trying to find balance. The 'Invisible Gym Membership™' concept explains the hidden energy toll of this constant internal negotiation, leading to fatigue. Learning 'Hostage Negotiation™' tactics helps you respond effectively to these signals."

The translator then suggests an appropriate 'ADHD-Kinetic Syncing™' or 'Dopamine Scaffolding™' response, like a 5-second wall push-up, helping you manage symptoms more effectively instead of just fighting them.
