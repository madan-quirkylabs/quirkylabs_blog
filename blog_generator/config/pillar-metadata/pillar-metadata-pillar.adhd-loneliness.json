Unlike situational loneliness, it can persist even when surrounded by people, rooted in a feeling that one's core way of thinking and experiencing the world isn't seen or validated. Social masking to fit in can further deepen this internal sense of isolation, as the authentic self remains hidden."

This extreme emotional sensitivity can make social interactions feel high-stakes and fraught with potential pain. To avoid this unbearable feeling, individuals with ADHD and RSD may preemptively withdraw from social situations, avoid forming new connections, or engage in people-pleasing to an exhausting degree, all of which can lead to profound social isolation."

While it might seem like a helpful short-term strategy, it's incredibly draining and creates a barrier to authentic connection. If you're constantly performing and not showing your true self, others can't connect with the real you, leading to a deep internal loneliness—feeling unknown even when you're with people."

It's important to explore these feelings with a trauma-informed professional if they resonate. Many neurodivergent-affirming therapists acknowledge this link.
