For 'Questioning Professionals' (often undiagnosed young adults), this is intensified by a lack of an explanatory framework for their ADHD-related struggles (like inconsistent performance or RSD), making them attribute challenges to personal failings rather than neurobiology. Their core question is often 'Am I broken/lazy, or is it ADHD?'."
