                            "text": "Technology is often overwhelming for individuals with ADHD due to a combination of factors related to their neurobiology. The ADHD brain often has lower baseline levels of dopamine, leading to seeking stimulation from engaging tech like social media or games. Executive function deficits make it harder to manage distractions, organize digital information, and resist impulses. The constant notifications and variable reward schedules of many apps can hijack attention and create cycles of problematic use."

Mindfully Manage Notifications: Turn off non-essential alerts and schedule specific times to check others. 2. Set Clear Boundaries: Designate tech-free zones/times and use tools to limit app usage. 3. Optimize Your Environment: Keep your workspace organized and phone out of sight during focus periods. 4. Understand Your Dopamine Triggers: Identify what tech activities provide the biggest dopamine hits and find healthier alternatives or ways to manage them. 5. Use ADHD-Friendly Tools: Leverage apps designed for focus, task management, and blocking distractions."

It can be particularly common with ADHD because the novelty and constant stream of information can provide a dopamine hit that the ADHD brain craves. Additionally, difficulties with emotional regulation and executive functions like inhibitory control can make it harder to stop scrolling once started."
