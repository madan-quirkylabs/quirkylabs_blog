However, for temporary or specific uses, 'neuro-surgical neutering' hacks include: 1. Using hyper-specific, pre-built templates (NOT building your own initially). 2. Imposing ruthless simplicity – one dedicated page per project, minimal databases. 3. Integrating it with external accountability or a 'body double' for usage. 4. Using it primarily as a 'second brain' for storage, not active task management, if executive functions are a major challenge.
