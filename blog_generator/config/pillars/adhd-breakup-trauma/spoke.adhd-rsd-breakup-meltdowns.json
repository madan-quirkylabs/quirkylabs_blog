        "Marital conflict and divorce rates were higher in couples where one partner had ADHD, suggesting ADHD contributes to relationship breakdown.",
        "Spouses often cited erratic behaviors (impulsivity, emotional outbursts) and poor follow-through by the ADHD partner as sources of chronic strain.",
        "In ADHD-affected divorces, individuals commonly experienced intense grief and self-blame, indicating they internalized the breakup as personal failure."
      ],
      "neurobiological_mechanism": "Emotionally impulsive reactions and poor self-regulation in ADHD can escalate conflicts beyond repair, and the subsequent loss may hyperactivate limbic pain circuits similarly to physical trauma.",
      "clinical_takeaway": "Couples counseling that addresses ADHD-specific issues (communication, task-sharing) may prevent relationship dissolution. For those already struggling post-breakup, therapy should target maladaptive guilt and promote resilience."

        "Individuals with ADHD who underwent intensive behavioral treatment in youth had somewhat more stable young-adult relationships, hinting early intervention might buffer later breakup risk."
      ],
      "neurobiological_mechanism": "ADHD‚Äôs impact on emotional control (due to fronto-limbic circuit inefficiencies) can yield volatile relationships, and repeated interpersonal failure can sensitize stress-response systems (like heightened cortisol) akin to trauma responses.",
