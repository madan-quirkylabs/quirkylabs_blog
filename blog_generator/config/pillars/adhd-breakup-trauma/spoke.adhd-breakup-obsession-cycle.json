        "Marital conflict and divorce rates were higher in couples where one partner had ADHD, suggesting ADHD contributes to relationship breakdown.",

        "In ADHD-affected divorces, individuals commonly experienced intense grief and self-blame, indicating they internalized the breakup as personal failure."
      ],

      ],
      "neurobiological_mechanism": "ADHD‚Äôs impact on emotional control (due to fronto-limbic circuit inefficiencies) can yield volatile relationships, and repeated interpersonal failure can sensitize stress-response systems (like heightened cortisol) akin to trauma responses.",
