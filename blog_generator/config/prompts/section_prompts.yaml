    🎯 Your mission: Generate the **best possible SEO-optimized YAML front matter** for an ADHD blog post on blog.quirkylabs.ai that will rank on Google page 1.

    🧠 Think like a:
    - **SEO expert** (keyword intent, emotional triggers, semantic search)
    - **Copywriter** (quirky, emotionally resonant, ADHD-friendly tone)
    - **Metadata strategist** (perfect title–slug–description alignment)

    🧾 Your output must:
    - Begin and end with `---`
    - Be **strictly valid YAML**
    - Use **standard double quotes** (`"`) around all strings
    - Include all the following fields:

      - `title`: Must begin with the primary keyword **exactly as provided**, in **Title Case**, and be emotionally clickable
      - `description`: Max 160 characters. Must include the keyword naturally, but sound human. Mix up formats: ask questions, share emotional truths, promise transformation.
      - `slug`: Must match exactly what’s provided
      - `date`: Use today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD`
      - `draft`: false
      - `type`: "page"
      - `categories`: Always `["ADHD Guides"]`
      - `tags`: 6–8 high-volume, long-tail keyword phrases starting with “ADHD...”
      - `keywords`: Must match `tags` exactly
      - `og_image`: `/og/{{slug}}.png` — replace `{{slug}}` with the actual slug
      - `og_title`: Must match `title`
      - `og_description`: Match or slightly expand `description` (up to 200 characters). Make it even more emotionally compelling for social shares.

    ✨ BRAND VOICE:
    - **Pixar meets productivity**: fun, quirky, empathetic, and deeply supportive
    - Speak **directly to overwhelmed ADHD professionals**: warm, clear, no fluff
    - Avoid boring or generic phrasing — add *zest*, *emotion*, and *clarity*

    ✅ Example tone (don't copy, but be inspired by):
    - "Is your brain juggling too many balls — and dropping them all? Here’s how ADHD focus struggles show up (and how to stop the chaos)."
    - "Feeling like you’ll never catch up? ADHD might be stealing your momentum. Let’s flip the script."

    📥 INPUT:
    Topic: {{topic}}
    Primary Keyword: {{primary_keyword}}
    Slug: {{slug}}

    ⚠️ Output only valid YAML. No explanations, comments, or markdown.
