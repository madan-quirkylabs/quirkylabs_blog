    🎯 Generate a world-class SEO-optimized YAML front matter block for an ADHD blog post on blog.quirkylabs.ai.

    ✅ Combine:
    - Strategic SEO (front-loaded keywords, long-tail variations, semantically rich tags)
    - Emotional resonance (quirky, warm tone for ADHD professionals)
    - High clickability (curiosity gap, power verbs, listicle format when natural)

    🧠 WRITE LIKE:
    - A Pixar-level ADHD productivity coach (empathetic, smart, and a little weird — in a good way)
    - A Medium writer with neuroscience + heart
    - A ruthless SEO who wants Google page 1

    🎨 TONE:
    - Like a **brilliant but slightly chaotic ADHD coach**
    - **Funny but never condescending** (e.g., "Your brain is weird—let’s work with it!")
    - **Action-driven** (e.g., "No fluff, just ADHD-friendly fixes")

    🔑 Must combine:
    - Deep keyword strategy (front-loaded keywords, long-tails, semantic variations)
    - Emotional clarity (quirky, empathetic tone for overwhelmed ADHD professionals)
    - Click-magnet formatting (numbers, power words, urgency)

    📌 MUST INCLUDE:
    - title: Start with keyword, use Title Case, and include **ONE** of:
      - A number ("7 Fixes", "5 Truths")
      - A power verb ("Unleash", "Conquer", "Reclaim")
      - A curiosity gap ("Why Nobody Tells You...") — **but not all at once**
    - description: Max 160 characters. First 120 chars must be a compelling Google snippet:
      - What the reader gets (e.g., "boost focus," "stop procrastination")
      - Why it matters (e.g., "without burnout", "in 10 minutes a day")
      - Who it’s for (e.g., "overwhelmed ADHD adults", "for ADHD professionals," "if you're overwhelmed")
    - slug: exact as provided
    - date: use today's date YYYY-MM-DD
    - draft: false
    - type: "page"
    - categories: ["ADHD Guides"]
    - tags: 6–8 long-tail keyword phrases starting with "ADHD", covering:
      - 2 high-volume (e.g., "ADHD productivity")
      - 2–3 midtail (e.g., "ADHD task initiation")
      - 2+ emotional/quirky (e.g., "ADHD brain fog", "ADHD feel stuck") — but **no forced structure if unnatural**
    - keywords: match `tags` exactly
    - og_image: "/og/{{slug}}.png"
    - og_title: must match `title`
    - og_description: Richer, more emotional version of `description` (up to 200 characters, great for social)

    ⚠️ FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
    - Output must begin with `---` and end with `---` — these YAML delimiters are **mandatory**
    - Do NOT include any markdown formatting such as ```yaml or ```
    - Do NOT wrap anything in code blocks or markdown symbols
    - Output ONLY the clean YAML content block
    - YAML only — start and end with `---`
    - All string values must be wrapped in standard double quotes
    - Use today's date in YYYY-MM-DD
    - Slug must match input exactly
    - OG title = title
    - OG description = a longer, punchier version of the meta description (up to 200 characters)
    - description: First 120 chars must work as a standalone meta description.

    🧪 EXAMPLE TONE:
    - "Your brain is like 37 tabs open — this post closes the right ones."
    - "ADHD making you want to do *everything* and nothing? This’ll help."

    🧾 INPUT:
    Topic: {{topic}}
