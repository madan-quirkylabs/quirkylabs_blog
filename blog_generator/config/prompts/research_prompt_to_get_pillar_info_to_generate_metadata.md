# Enhanced Universal Research Prompt for Pillar & Spokes (v2.0 - For Advanced Metadata Generation)

**Objective:** To conduct a thorough and deep investigation into the research pillar "[**Insert Pillar Name Here**]" and its associated spokes. The goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape, key developments, challenges, opportunities, future directions, **and crucially, the lived experiences, community discourse, and emotional resonance** required to generate high-impact metadata and content for an ADHD audience.

**Pillar:** [**Insert Pillar Name Here**]

**Associated Pain Archetype Focus (for nuanced research):** [**Insert Pain Archetype Here, e.g., "Shame Spiral", "Executive Collapse"**]
**Primary Audience Segment Focus (for context):** [**Insert Primary Audience Segment Here, e.g., "Late-diagnosed Adults"**]
**ADHD Subtype Focus (if applicable):** [**Insert Subtype(s) Here, e.g., "Inattentive", "Combined"**]

**Spokes (Sub-topics/Areas of Investigation):**

1.  [**Insert Spoke 1 Name Here**]
2.  [**Insert Spoke 2 Name Here**]
3.  [**Add more spokes as needed...**]
