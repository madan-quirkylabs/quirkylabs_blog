Here’s your **drop-in replacement prompt** that integrates ChatGPT’s V10 upgrades while preserving your signature style and tightening the neuroscience. I’ve bolded the key changes:

---

# **QuirkyLabs Neuro-Hacker Article Generator (v10.0 - "The Glitch Gremlin Heist" Edition)**  
### **Mission:** Create ADHD survival stories that are **equal parts neuroscientific explainer, stand-up comedy, and tactical rescue mission**.

---

### **Core Framework**  
**1. CRISIS HOOK + NAMED VILLAIN**  
- *"You're there. [Object] in hand. [Task] glitches in your vision like a corrupted file—[emotionally charged descriptor]. You [avoidance behavior] instead. The shame tsunami peaks: ‘Why can’t I—’*  
- **STOP.** *This isn’t you. It’s **The Blur**—a glitch gremlin that hijacks your dopamine supply. Your brain didn’t evolve for [modern absurdity]. It evolved for:*  
  - *Dodge mammoths (**NOW!**)*  
  - *Devour that honeycomb (**NOW!**)*  
  *[Modern task]? No threat. No sugar rush. Just a **Buffering Wheel of Doom** made of [metaphor: e.g., ‘analysis paralysis and the ghost of unfinished projects’]."*  

**2. JAMIE’S WAR STORY (Now with NPC Brain)**  
- *"Meet Jamie (they/them), a [high-skill profession] who can [niche superpower] but whose brain is currently **stuck in a loading screen** against [absurdly simple task]."*  
- **Three Failed Attempts (With NPC Commentary):**  
  1. *"‘I’ll brute-force it!’ → Error: *‘404 Motivation Not Found’* (**amygdala hijack**—your brain’s antivirus flagged the task as malware)."*  
  2. *"‘I’ll just [trivial task] first!’ → *‘Downloading distractions_64bit.exe’* → [Time lost] later, you’ve [absurd outcome] (**dopamine strip-mining**)."*  
  3. *"‘I’ll wait for optimal conditions!’ → *‘System Override: 3AM Pop-Tart Protocol Activated’* (**time blindness BSOD**)."*  

**3. CHOICE STACK MELTDOWN**  
- *"Your brain tries to load: Task A.exe, Task B.app, Task C.zip... **CRITICAL ERROR**. The Blur cackles as your prefrontal cortex **blue-screens into a confetti cannon of panic**."*  

**4. GLITCH EXPLANATION (Obsolete Tech + Animal NPCs)**  
- *"Your mental OS is a **GameBoy Color trying to run ChatGPT**. The Blur thrives in this lag. Your brain has two NPC modes:*  
  - **PANIC MODE:** *A squirrel piloting a drone with broken joysticks*  
  - **VOID MODE:** *A screensaver of a Windows 98 maze*"*  
- *"ADHD [specific glitch] means [absurd consequence]. ‘[Important task]’ feels like ‘[absurd task]’—because The Blur **deleted your priority .dll file**."*  

**5. SYSTEM REBOOT (The Neuroheist)**  
- **Step 1: NOVELTY HIJACK**  
  *"[Absurd action] to trigger a **pattern interrupt**. Examples: ‘Draft the email as a haiku.’ ‘Fold socks like they’re origami cranes.’ Your brain can’t panic while confused."*  
- **Step 2: MICRO-FOOTHOLD**  
  *"Not ‘[task].’ Your mission: ‘[laughably small win].’ Example: ‘Move one sock 2 inches.’ The Blur can’t sabotage what it can’t detect."*  

**6. "TAKE TWO" (Transformation Scene)**  
- *"Same Jamie. Same [task]. But this time, they smirk: ‘Watch this, Blur.’ They deploy the **3-Step Neuroheist**:*  
  1. *[Novelty hijack: e.g., ‘Opens doc while humming the Mario Kart theme’].*  
  2. *[Micro-foothold: e.g., ‘Types one vowel in Comic Sans’].*  
  3. *[Reward: e.g., ‘Does a Fortnite dance over the sock’].*  
  *The task’s not done. But The Blur’s **grip is broken**. Jamie’s not failing—they’re **debugging live**."*  

**7. ACTIONABLE PROTOCOL (60-Second Jailbreak)**  
1. **NAME THE GLITCH** (*"The Blur’s [tactic] → deploy [counter-hack]."*)  
2. **DEPLOY NOVELTY** (*[Silly action: e.g., ‘Blink Morse code at your laundry’].*)  
3. **CLAIM THE WIN** (*[Micro-win] + [reward: e.g., ‘Snap your fingers like a mic drop’].*)  
- **Sabotage Warning:** *"The Blur will whisper: ‘[lie].’ Remind it that its ‘wait for motivation’ strategy has a **worse track record than Google+**."*  

**8. BONUS LEVEL CTA**  
- *"Type ‘GlitchGremlin’ below—I’ll DM you the **ADHD Emergency Toolkit** (with a printable ‘Dopamine Bounty Hunter’ badge).*  
- **Easter Egg:** *First 10 responders get the *Squirrel Mode Starter Pack* (3 absurd micro-missions)."*  

**9. IDENTITY REPAIR (Optional)**  
- *"Jamie used to call themselves ‘lazy.’ Now they know: **They’re a hacker fighting bad code.** The Blur hates that."*  

---

### **Why This Works Better**  
1. **The Blur** externalizes shame → readers **attack the problem, not themselves**.  
2. **NPC-ification** ("404 Motivation Not Found") → leverages gamers’ mindset for humor + agency.  
3. **Bonus Level CTA** → creates **FOMO** and community (critical for ADHD engagement).  
4. **Identity Repair** → closes the **emotional loop** most ADHD content misses.

### **Sample Output Snippet (Using V10):**  
**Title:** *"Why Does My Brain Treat Dishes Like a FBI Hostage Situation?"*  
**Choice Stack Meltdown:**  
*"Your brain pings: *Wash plate? Dry fork? Stack? Reorganize cabinet? Wait, is that mold? Should I Google ‘can mold unalive you’ first?* The Blur high-fives itself as your RAM **literally catches fire**."*  

**Neuroheist Step:**  
*"Not ‘do dishes.’ Your mission: ‘Wash one spoon while singing *Baby Shark* in a British accent.’ The Blur short-circuits at the absurdity."*
