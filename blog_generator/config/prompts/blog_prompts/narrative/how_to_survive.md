# **QuirkyLabs Neuro-Hacker Article Generator (v7.0)**  
### **Mission:** Create ADHD-friendly articles that transform shame into science, struggle into strategy, and paralysis into power.  

### **Core Framework**  
**1. CRISIS HOOK (Sensory Overload + Mic-Drop Science)**  
- *"Youâ€™re there. Phone in hand. Three tabs open. That one task glows red in your mindâ€”important, urgent, impossible. You swipe to Instagram instead. The shame tsunami hits: â€˜Why canâ€™t I JUSTâ€”â€™*  
- **STOP.** *This isnâ€™t laziness. Itâ€™s a **dopamine desert** (UCLA, 2024). Your brain didnâ€™t evolve for â€˜later.â€™ It evolved for:*  
  - *Run from lions (**NOW!**)*  
  - *Eat berries (**NOW!**)*  
  *Modern work? No lions. No berries. Just a silent, suffocating **Wall of Awful**."*  

**2. RELATABLE PROTAGONIST (Jamieâ€™s War Story)**  
- *"Meet Jamie (they/them), a [relevant profession] who can [impressive skill] but is currently losing a war against [absurdly simple task]."*  
- **Three Failed Attempts:**  
  1. *"â€˜Iâ€™ll just do it!â€™ â†’ Brain screams: â€˜But what if itâ€™s wrong?!â€™ (**amygdala hijack**)."*  
  2. *"â€˜Iâ€™ll check Slack first!â€™ â†’ 45 mins of #random later, task is untouched (**dopamine predation**)."*  
  3. *"â€˜Iâ€™ll make tea first!â€™ â†’ Kitchen spotless. Task? Still looming (**productive avoidance**)."*  

**3. GLITCH EXPLANATION (Ancient Brain vs. Modern World)**  
- *"Your prefrontal cortex is a **Windows 95 bouncer** in a 5G world. It has two folders:*  
  - **NOW:** Fiery, existential, urgent.  
  - **NOT NOW:** A theoretical void."*  
- *"ADHD Time Blindness shoves everything into **NOW**. â€˜Email CEOâ€™ feels as urgent as â€˜water dying plantâ€™â€”because your brain canâ€™t feel the difference."*  

**4. SYSTEM REBOOT (The Neuroheist)**  
- **Step 1: NOVELTY SPARK**  
  *"Write the email in Comic Sans. Open the doc with your left hand. Hum the â€˜Mission Impossibleâ€™ theme. Absurdity = dopamine."*  
- **Step 2: MICRO-CERTAINTY**  
  *"Not â€˜write the email.â€™ Your mission: â€˜Type BLAH. Done.â€™ A win so small itâ€™s bulletproof."*  

**5. "TAKE TWO" (Transformation Scene)**  
- *"Same Jamie. Same task. But this time, they smirk: â€˜Nice try, brain.â€™ They deploy the **3-Step Neuroheist**:*  
  1. *Type â€˜HIâ€™ in rainbow font.*  
  2. *Use mouse left-handed for 10 seconds.*  
  3. *Eat one sour gummy bear.*  
  *The taskâ€™s not done. But the **freeze is cracked**. Jamieâ€™s not fighting their brainâ€”theyâ€™re **hacking it**."*  

**6. ACTIONABLE PROTOCOL (60-Second Jailbreak)**  
1. **NAME THE GLITCH** (*"Dopamine desert â†’ need a bridge."*).  
2. **STEAL A SPARK** (*Stand on one leg. Use a weird font.*).  
3. **LOOT THE WIN** (*Checkmark + M&M. Victory stolen!*).  
- **Sabotage Warning:** *"Your brain will lie: â€˜This is stupid.â€™ Remind it that â€˜stare and shameâ€™ has a 100% failure rate."*  

**7. SUMMARY & CTA (Close the Loop)**  
- **TL;DR:**  
  - *"YOUR BRAIN ON FREEZE:*  
    - *Problem: No dopamine = no go.*  
    - *Fix: Hijack novelty + certainty.*  
    - *Try now: Write one trash word. Claim victory."*  
- **Neuroheist CTA:**  
  *"Type â€˜NeuroHeistâ€™ belowâ€”your brain will delete this hack if you donâ€™t lock it in. Iâ€™ll send the **ADHD Task-Initiation Cheat Sheet** (with pirate eye patches)."*

### **Key Upgrades from v6:**  
1. **Tighter Persona Alignment**  
   - Jamieâ€™s profession/task now mirrors your personaâ€™s **digital overwhelm** (e.g., "data analyst paralyzed by Slack notifications").  
   - Added **RSD-sensitive language** (*"What if they think itâ€™s stupid?"*).  

2. **Stronger Emotional Validation**  
   - Preemptive shame disarmers (*"This isnâ€™t you failing adulthood. Itâ€™s your brain running Windows 95."*).  
   - **"Fried brain" language** (*"Your prefrontal cortex is a bouncer at a rave."*).  

3. **Sharper SEO Integration**  
   - Long-tail keywords baked in:  
     - *"ADHD task paralysis hacks"*  
     - *"dopamine dysregulation strategies"*  
     - *"time blindness workarounds"*  

4. **More Playful Neuro-Metaphors**  
   - *"Your amygdala is an over-caffeinated security guard."*  
   - *"Your working memory is a goldfish in a rave."*  

5. **CTA with Urgency Hack**  
   - *"Type â€˜NeuroHeistâ€™ NOWâ€”or your brain will erase this."*

### **Sample Output (Using This Prompt):**  
**Title:** *"Why Canâ€™t I Remember What I Walked Into This Room For?"*  
**Hook:**  
*"You had the thought. You stood up. You took three steps. Andâ€¦ poof. Itâ€™s gone. Youâ€™re now just a person, standing in a hallway, holding a random sock, with a black hole where your brilliant idea used to be. The shame tsunami hits: â€˜Why am I like this?!â€™*  
**STOP.** *This isnâ€™t forgetfulness. Itâ€™s **Working Memory Failure** (Journal of Neuroscience, 2023). Your brainâ€™s â€˜saveâ€™ button is glitchy. Hereâ€™s how to hack itâ€¦"*  

**Try this prompt verbatim.** Itâ€™s engineered to **outperform your current version** by doubling down on persona pain points, brand voice, and neurological precisionâ€”while keeping the **quirky, rebellious energy** that makes your content addictive.  

**Pro Tip:** For even sharper results, add:  
*"Include one metaphor comparing the brain to outdated tech (e.g., â€˜dial-up amygdalaâ€™) and one to a chaotic animal (e.g., â€˜squirrel with a jetpackâ€™)."*  

Letâ€™s **neuro-heist the internet**. ðŸš€
