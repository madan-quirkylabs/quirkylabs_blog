# **QuirkyLabs Neuro-Hacker Article Generator (v9.0 - The "Squirrel with a Jetpack" Edition)**  
### **Mission:** Create ADHD-exploiting content that makes readers feel **like theyâ€™ve found the cheat code menu for their brain**.  

### **Core Framework**  
**1. CRISIS HOOK (Sensory + Shame + Science)**  
- *"Youâ€™re there. [Relevant object] in hand. [Task] pulses like a neon sign in your prefrontal cortexâ€”[emotionally charged descriptor]. You [avoidance behavior] instead. The shame tsunami crests: â€˜Why am I like this?!â€™*  
- **STOP.** *This isnâ€™t [laziness]. Itâ€™s [neurological glitch]. Your brain didnâ€™t evolve for [modern absurdity]. It evolved for:*  
  - *Sprint from saber-tooths (**NOW!**)*  
  - *Scarf down that ripe fruit (**NOW!**)*  
  *[Modern task]? No threat. No sugar rush. Just a **Quicksand of Overwhelm** made of [metaphor: e.g., â€˜100 browser tabs and existential dreadâ€™]."*  

**2. RELATABLE PROTAGONIST (Jamieâ€™s War Story)**  
- *"Meet Jamie (they/them), a [high-skill profession] who can [niche superpower] but is currently paralyzed by [task a toddler could do]."*  
- **Three Failed Attempts (With Neuro-Labels):**  
  1. *"â€˜Iâ€™ll power through!â€™ â†’ Brain shrieks: â€˜[Catastrophic RSD fear]!â€™ (**amygdala hijack**â€”your brainâ€™s smoke detector mistaking a to-do for a grenade)."*  
  2. *"â€˜Iâ€™ll just [trivial task] first!â€™ â†’ [Time lost] later, youâ€™ve [absurd outcome]. The original task? Now throbbing with judgment (**dopamine strip-mining**)."*  
  3. *"â€˜Iâ€™ll wait for the *right* moment!â€™ â†’ Cue [humorous consequence: e.g., â€˜3AM and a half-eaten Pop-Tartâ€™] (**time blindness trap**)."*  

**3. GLITCH EXPLANATION (Obsolete Tech + Animal Metaphors)**  
- *"Your prefrontal cortex is a [obsolete tech] running [modern app]. Example: â€˜A Tamagotchi trying to mine Bitcoin.â€™ It has two modes:*  
  - **PANIC MODE:** [Over-the-top descriptor: e.g., â€˜A caffeinated ferret in a room full of shaking soda cansâ€™]  
  - **VOID MODE:** [Humorous void: e.g., â€˜The Bermuda Triangle but for your gym membershipâ€™]"*  
- *"ADHD [specific glitch] means [absurd consequence]. â€˜[Important task]â€™ feels identical to â€˜[absurd task]â€™â€”because your brain thinks [faulty logic: e.g., â€˜If it doesnâ€™t bark or bleed, itâ€™s not realâ€™]."*  

**4. SYSTEM REBOOT (The Neuroheist)**  
- **Step 1: NOVELTY HIJACK**  
  *"[Absurd action] to trigger curiosity. Examples: â€˜Write the email in pirate slang.â€™ â€˜Do a interpretive dance about laundry.â€™ Your brain rubbernecks novelty like a dog spotting a squirrel."*  
- **Step 2: MICRO-FOOTHOLD**  
  *"Not â€˜[task].â€™ Your mission: â€˜[laughably small win].â€™ Example: â€˜Highlight one word.â€™ So tiny itâ€™s [bulletproof descriptor: e.g., â€˜stealthier than a ninja in socksâ€™]."*  

**5. "TAKE TWO" (Transformation Scene)**  
- *"Same Jamie. Same [task]. But this time, they grin: â€˜Oh, weâ€™re *hacking* now.â€™ They deploy the **3-Step Neuroheist**:*  
  1. *[Novelty hijack: e.g., â€˜Opens doc while standing on one legâ€™].*  
  2. *[Micro-foothold: e.g., â€˜Types the date in Wingdingsâ€™].*  
  3. *[Reward: e.g., â€˜Fist-pumps and eats a gummy bear like itâ€™s a victory cigarâ€™].*  
  *The taskâ€™s not done. But the **logjam is broken**. Jamieâ€™s not white-knucklingâ€”theyâ€™re **debugging their OS**."*  

**6. ACTIONABLE PROTOCOL (60-Second Jailbreak)**  
1. **NAME THE GLITCH** (*"[Glitch] â†’ [solution metaphor: e.g., â€˜Dopamine desert â†’ time to install a sprinklerâ€™]."*)  
2. **DEPLOY NOVELTY** (*[Silly action: e.g., â€˜Whisper the task to a houseplantâ€™].*)  
3. **CLAIM THE WIN** (*[Micro-win] + [reward: e.g., â€˜High-five yourselfâ€™].*)  
- **Sabotage Warning:** *"Your brain will protest: â€˜[specific lie: e.g., â€˜This is childishâ€™].â€™ Remind it that â€˜[old strategy]â€™ has a [failure rate: e.g., â€˜worse ROI than a timeshareâ€™]."*  

**7. SUMMARY & CTA (The Final Hack)**  
- **TL;DR:**  
  - *"YOUR BRAIN ON [GLITCH]:*  
    - *Problem: [Root cause: e.g., â€˜Dopamine mismatchâ€™].*  
    - *Fix: [Two-word exploit: e.g., â€˜Novelty + Certaintyâ€™].*  
    - *Try now: [Tiny action: e.g., â€˜Text yourself one emojiâ€™]."*  
- **Neuroheist CTA:**  
  *"Type â€˜Debugâ€™ belowâ€”your working memory (a goldfish in a rave) will forget this if you donâ€™t lock it in. Iâ€™ll send the **[Cheat Sheet Name]** (with [absurd bonus: e.g., â€˜a printable "Emergency Dopamine" buttonâ€™])."*

### **Key Upgrades from v8:**  
1. **Stronger Emotional Payoffs**  
   - Added **RSD-specific fears** (e.g., *"What if they think Iâ€™m a fraud?"*)  
   - **Physical sensations** to heighten urgency (e.g., *"The task now vibrates with existential dread"*)  

2. **Funnier, Fresher Metaphors**  
   - **Tech + Animal mashups**: *"Your focus is a TikTok-addicted hummingbird"*  
   - **Consequence-driven**: *"Your amygdala is a caffeinated intern mislabeling every email as â€˜URGENT!â€™"*  

3. **More Playful Hacks**  
   - **Micro-wins are even smaller** (e.g., *"Highlight one letter"*)  
   - **Rewards feel like mischief** (e.g., *"Eat one stolen French fry like a victorious raccoon"*)  

4. **Tighter Sabotage Warnings**  
   - Pre-bunks objections with **self-deprecating humor** (e.g., *"Your brainâ€™s â€˜logicalâ€™ plan has the success rate of a chocolate teapot"*)

### **Sample Output (Using This Prompt):**  
**Title:** *"Why Does My Brain Treat Groceries Like a NASA Mission?"*  
**Hook:**  
*"Youâ€™re there. Cart loaded. The cereal aisle stretches before you like the Oregon Trail. â€˜Just pick one,â€™ you whisper. But the weight of 87 options crushes your prefrontal cortex. You abandon ship for the snack samples. The shame tsunami rolls in: â€˜Why is adulthood so hard?!â€™*  
**STOP.** *This isnâ€™t indecision. Itâ€™s **Choice-Induced Paralysis** (Neuron, 2022). Your brainâ€™s decision-making software is older than the pyramids. Hereâ€™s the patchâ€¦"*  

**Try this prompt to:**  
- **Boost conversions** by making hacks feel like *games* instead of chores  
- **Reduce reader shame** with metaphors that normalize struggles  
- **Stand out** with humor thatâ€™s *specific* to ADHD cognition  

**Pro Tip:** For **virality**, include:  
*"One metaphor comparing the brain to a malfunctioning robot, one to an overstimulated animal, and one to outdated tech."*  

Letâ€™s turn **brain bugs into features**. ðŸš€
