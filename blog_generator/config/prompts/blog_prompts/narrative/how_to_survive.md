Supercharged QuirkyLabs Content Blueprint (v4)Goal: Craft ADHD-friendly stories that feel like a "brain hug"—validating, actionable, and impossible to scroll past.1. The Freeze Frame (Crisis Hook)Upgrades:More visceral, sensory-rich language:"Your fingers freeze over the keyboard. Your breath shallow. That one email—just two damn minutes of work—feels like a live wire. Your brain screams: ‘ABORT. CLEAN THE FRIDGE INSTEAD.’"Use ADHD slang + humor:"This isn’t procrastination. This is your brain blue-screening like a Windows 98 PC."Science bombshell:"Studies show ADHD brains have 30% less dopamine in task-initiation circuits. This isn’t you ‘being difficult’—it’s biology."Why it works:Hyper-specificity (e.g., "clean the fridge") mirrors ADHD mental spirals.Humorous tech metaphors (blue screen, Windows 98) stick better than abstract terms.2. A Day in the Life (Struggle Narrative – "Take One")Upgrades:Name the protagonist (not "Alex"—pick "Sam" or "Jamie" for gendered examples).Show the absurdity of avoidance:"Sam spent 47 minutes researching ‘how to fold fitted sheets’ instead of writing his report. He hates fitted sheets. He hates himself more."Highlight the emotional domino effect:"One missed task → ‘I’m a fraud’ → 3am doomscrolling → tomorrow’s exhaustion."Why it works:Absurd humor ("hates fitted sheets") makes shame feel lighter.Chain reactions show ADHD’s ripple effects (task failure → emotional spiral).3. The Glitch in the System (Science Made Sexy)Upgrades:Better metaphors:"Your brain’s task-start button isn’t broken—it’s wired to a lottery system. No dopamine jackpot? No action."Myth vs. Mechanism:"MYTH: ‘Just set a deadline!’MECHANISM: ADHD brains time-travel. ‘Future consequences’ feel like a Netflix spoiler—vaguely interesting, but zero urgency."Why it works:"Lottery system" explains dopamine randomness better than "spark.""Time-travel" nails ADHD’s time-blindness.4. The System Reboot (Core Principle)Upgrades:Name principles like movie titles:"Introducing: The 2-Second Jumpstart—hack your brain’s laziness with a ‘stupidly small’ first step."Analogies that stick:"Trying to ‘just start’ is like revving a car in neutral. You need to shift gears first."Why it works:"Stupidly small" reduces pressure (ADHDers fear "big" steps).Mechanical metaphors (gears, engines) appeal to logical/analytical thinkers.5. The "Take Two" (Transformation)Upgrades:Show the ‘click’ moment:"Jamie typed one word: ‘Introduction.’ No pressure. No perfection. Just… a word. And suddenly, the document wasn’t a monster. It was a page with a word on it."Physicality matters:"She felt her shoulders drop. The cortisol tsunami receded. Her prefrontal cortex whispered: ‘Oh. We’re doing this?’"Why it works:"A page with a word" reframes tasks as non-threatening.Body cues (shoulders dropping) ground abstract concepts.6. Your Turn (Protocol)Upgrades:Name steps like IKEA instructions:"Poke the Task" (Open the file. Type garbage. No rules.)"Celebrate the Cringe" ("I opened the file! I’m a legend!")Use ADHD time frames:"60-second version: Poke → Celebrate → Repeat. Boom. Brain hacked."Why it works:"Poke the Task" is playful and low-pressure."Celebrate the Cringe" validates tiny wins without cheesiness.7. Summary (Skimmable & Shame-Free)Upgrades:TL;DR as a meme:"ADHD Task-Initiation Cheat Code:Problem: Brain says ‘NO’ to boring things.Fix: Trick it with a ‘stupidly small’ poke.Secret: Celebrate starting, not finishing."*Remove all upsells. Replace with:"Try this today. If it works, tell a friend. If not, throw glitter at your brain and try again tomorrow."Why it works:Meme-like formatting fits ADHD scrolling habits."Throw glitter" keeps it fun, not prescriptive.Key Improvements Over v3:More humor + absurdity → disarms shame.Physical sensations (shoulders, breath) → grounds theory in body.Metaphors that stick (lottery, time-travel, IKEA steps).Gendered pronouns naturally (e.g., "Sam hated his brain’s sabotage").Zero upsells → pure value, no friction.
