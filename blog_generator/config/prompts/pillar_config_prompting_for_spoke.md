**Hidden E-E-A-T Layer:**  
```json
"alt_text": "Prefrontal cortex dysfunction in ADHD time perception (2024 fMRI study)",  
"footer_link": "/adhd-time-blindness-neuroscience"  
```

  "questions": [
    "Ever convinced yourself ‘I work better under pressure’ right before sobbing at 3AM?",

- *“Is time blindness a form of brain damage?”* (controversial snippet bait)  

**Video Targets:**  
- *“ADHD facial expressions when realizing a deadline is today”*  

---

#### **5. Keyword Enforcement
- Targets Google’s MUM algorithm (understands conversational links)
- "Time crimes log" = meme Google now indexes as semantic entity

```json
"keyword_strategy": {
  "primary": "adhd time blindness",
  "voice_combat": [
    "Hey Google why does ADHD make me late every day",
    "Alexa how to explain ADHD time blindness to my boss"
  ],
  "reddit_speak": ["time fugitive", "ADHD time crimes log"],
  "medical_entities": ["temporal discounting", "striatal dysfunction"]
}
```

#### **6. Internal Linking → Strategic Topic Dominance
- "Gaslighting" anchor = emotional trigger + topical relevance
- JAMA link = E-E-A-T detonation

```json
"link_ops": {
  "silo_storm": [
    {
      "slug": "adhd-procrastination-myths",
      "anchor": "why 'just start earlier' is gaslighting"
    },
    {
      "slug": "adhd-time-management",
      "anchor": "when planners make it worse"
    }
  ],
  "authority_nuke": {
    "url": "https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/123456",
    "anchor": "2024 JAMA study on ADHD temporal perception"
  }
}
```

#### **7. Skimmability → ADHD-Optimized UX
- "Pattern interrupts" prevent zoning out
- Dark mode default respects light sensitivity

```json
"neuro_ux": {
  "chunking": {
    "max_lines": 3,
    "visual_breakers": ["💥", "⏳", "🧠"]
  },
  "attention_physics": {
    "focal_points": 5,
    "pattern_interrupts": 2
  },
  "dyslexia_shields": {
    "font_contrast": "dark_mode",
    "line_animation": "static"
  }
}
```

## **🛠️ CRITICAL UPGRADES TO RESPECT
1. **Keyword Enforcement →** Use `keyword_clusters` with voice/meme/medical layers  
2. **Internal Linking →** Deploy `link_ops` with silo_storm + authority_nuke strategies  
3. **Readability →** Implement `neuro_ux` for ADHD-optimized scanning  
4. **Automation →** Add `ml_signals` for AI training and cross-cluster boosting  

**Example Injection:**  
```json
"ml_signals": {
  "topic_cluster": "adhd-executive-dysfunction",
  "psychographic_label": "high-functioning but drowning",
  "trauma_trigger": "fear_of_exposure"
}
```
