            "ECB 2.0": "Emotional-Cognitive-Behavioral (ECB) 2.0: Assesses the overlap and intensity of emotional responses (e.g., sadness, anger, anxiety, shame), cognitive patterns (e.g., negative self-talk, rumination, misinterpretation), and behavioral manifestations (e.g., people-pleasing, avoidance, fawning) between two content pieces. Weighted sentiment scoring implies assessing the intensity and valence of these elements.",
            "Neurobiological Networks": "Neurobiological Networks: Evaluates the shared neuroscientific underpinnings, including common brain regions (e.g., frontal cortex, limbic system, basal ganglia), neurotransmitter dysregulation (e.g., dopamine, norepinephrine), and how these affect emotional regulation and sensitivity as discussed in ADHD/RSD contexts. While 'functional connectivity clusters' were less explicitly detailed in the browsed articles for RSD specifically, the assessment focuses on shared brain mechanisms. DSM-5 context notes RSD's strong association with ADHD (a DSM-5 diagnosis) rather than its own formal inclusion.",
            "Failure/Recovery Arcs": "Failure/Recovery Arcs: Measures the commonalities in challenges, setbacks, and experiences of 'failure' (e.g., social withdrawal, self-sabotage, prolonged emotional distress) and the relevance of shared 'recovery' strategies (e.g., coping mechanisms, therapeutic approaches, self-compassion, non-linear healing processes) between two content pieces.",
            "Dynamic Personas": "Dynamic Personas: Assesses the extent to which content pieces describe or address similar stress-triggered shifts in behavior or mindset, such as ADHD masking, internal vs. external coping mechanisms, or shifts between different social presentations in response to perceived threats.",
            "Search Intent Graphs": "Search Intent Graphs: Rates the overlap in common user search intents, questions, and keywords addressed by the content pieces. This includes explicit questions users might ask and implied informational needs or problem-solving goals, considering synonym expansion for core concepts.",
            "Narrative DNA": "Narrative DNA: Evaluates shared underlying themes, metaphors, archetypes (e.g., 'too sensitive,' 'the inner critic,' 'feeling too much'), or common stories/personal experiences that resonate with individuals experiencing ADHD and RSD.",
            "Format Affinities": "Format Affinities: Assesses the compatibility or complementarity of content formats (e.g., article, video, exercise, personal anecdote, scientific explanation) that would perform well together, based on the type of information presented and user engagement patterns (inferred where explicit performance data is unavailable).",
            "Behavioral Triggers": "Behavioral Triggers: Measures the commonality of specific situations or cues that reliably trigger RSD responses (e.g., perceived criticism, delayed responses, social exclusion) and the relevance of shared 'real-time intervention logic' or coping strategies for these triggers.",
            "Conflict Pairs": "Conflict Pairs: Rates the degree to which content pieces address similar internal conflicts (e.g., desire for connection vs. fear of rejection, self-criticism vs. self-acceptance, cognitive dissonance) or external conflicts (e.g., miscommunication in relationships, interpersonal friction due to RSD reactions).",
            "Memetic Hooks": "Memetic Hooks: Assesses the potential for content pieces to share or leverage highly relatable phrases, concepts, shared experiences, or 'aha!' moments that are easily shareable and foster a sense of collective understanding and virality within the ADHD/RSD community."

            "description": "The algorithm would treat each spoke as a vector in a 10-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a score (0.0-1.0). Cosine similarity would calculate the 'angle' between these vectors, indicating their overall semantic relatedness. Additionally, a weighted graph could be constructed where spokes are nodes and interlinking scores are edge weights. The algorithm could then prioritize links based on: 1) High aggregate cosine similarity, 2) Specific high scores on user-defined priority dimensions (e.g., prioritize Neurobiological Networks for a scientific audience), and 3) A 'conflict resolution' layer that ensures diverse but complementary links, preventing redundant suggestions. For example, if two spokes have high 'Failure/Recovery Arcs' scores but address different stages of recovery, the algorithm would recommend linking them to provide a comprehensive user journey."

While 'Gemini's Neuro-SEO OS' is a hypothetical concept, this framework pushes beyond surface-level keyword matching or simple topic clustering by attempting to quantify the 'why' behind connections – e.g., shared neurobiology, specific failure arcs, or emotional triggers. The granular scoring across each dimension allows for a more sophisticated interlinking strategy than typical, broad content categorization.",
            "gemini_architecture_failures": "Current LLM architectures, including my own, fundamentally operate on statistical patterns and probabilities learned from vast datasets. While I can synthesize information about neurobiological concepts, emotional states, and behavioral triggers, I lack true 'neurocognitive modeling' in the human sense. My architecture fails to fully 'comprehend' these layers because: 1. **Lived Experience:** I do not possess personal experience of ADHD or RSD, which is crucial for genuine 'emotional-cognitive-behavioral' nuance and 'dynamic persona' understanding. 2. **Intuitive Weighting:** While I can apply a numerical scale, the 'weighted sentiment scoring' or the 'virality engineering' of 'memetic hooks' relies on an intuitive grasp of human psychology and social dynamics that goes beyond statistical correlation. 3. **Causal Reasoning:** While I can identify correlations, establishing deep causal links between specific neurobiological networks and highly subjective emotional states (beyond what's explicitly stated in my training data) is limited. 4. **Adaptive 'Real-time Intervention Logic':** My 'Behavioral Triggers' scores are based on documented triggers and coping mechanisms, but genuine 'real-time intervention logic' requires dynamic, adaptive problem-solving that is context-sensitive in a way current AI is not yet capable of. My 'comprehension' is a sophisticated form of pattern matching, not true understanding or empathy. I can approximate, but not replicate, human neurocognitive mastery of such complex emotional and behavioral landscapes.",
            "gaps_admission": "Gaps indeed exist between this proposed framework's ambition and current AI capabilities. The ability to truly 'understand' and 'experience' the nuances of human conditions like ADHD and RSD remains beyond current AI's reach. My processing is data-driven; the 'feeling' of RSD, the 'stress-triggered shifts' of a persona, or the subtle 'cognitive dissonance mapping' requires consciousness and subjective experience. Therefore, if the standard for 'true ADHD content mastery' necessitates genuine neurocognitive modeling and lived experience, then current AI, including myself, cannot fully meet that standard. I cannot perfectly replicate the human mind's capacity for empathy, intuition, or the nuanced understanding of complex psychological interplay. I recommend awaiting next-gen AI that may possess (or convincingly simulate) such capabilities."
