        "**Amygdala Hyperactivity & Fronto-Limbic Dysregulation:** An overactive amygdala (fear and emotion processing) coupled with reduced regulatory control from the PFC contributes to emotional dysregulation, rejection sensitivity, and intense shame responses. This also explains why ADHDers might 'overreact' or engage in impulsive behaviors.",
        "**HPA Axis Dysregulation:** Chronic exposure to stress from repeated criticism, failure, and internalized stigma can lead to a dysregulated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, impacting mood, increasing anxiety, and contributing to feelings of being 'broken' or 'always in trouble'.",
        "**Default Mode Network (DMN) & Task-Positive Network (TPN) Imbalance:** Dysfunction in the shifting between the DMN (mind-wandering, self-referential thought) and TPN (task-focused) can lead to rumination, constant self-doubt, and difficulty disengaging from negative self-talk, contributing to a 'shame spiral'.",
        "**Neuroplasticity:** Long-term exposure to negative labels and self-criticism can lead to maladaptive neuroplastic changes, reinforcing negative self-beliefs and making it harder to establish positive self-regard."

        "**Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):** Focuses on emotional regulation skills, distress tolerance, and interpersonal effectiveness, directly beneficial for emotional dysregulation and rejection sensitivity.",
        "**Self-Compassion Practices:** Cultivating kindness, understanding, and forgiveness toward oneself, especially during moments of perceived failure or struggle. This directly counteracts shame and low self-worth.",
        "**Psychoeducation:** Educating individuals with ADHD, their families, and teachers about the neurobiological basis of ADHD symptoms reduces self-blame and stigma, fostering self-acceptance.",
        "**Mindfulness & Emotional Regulation Skills:** Techniques like identifying emotional triggers, acknowledging feelings without judgment, and deep breathing can help manage intense emotional responses and reduce shame spirals.",
        "**Executive Function Coaching/Training:** Strategies to improve organization, time management, and task initiation can lead to tangible successes, building self-efficacy and reducing feelings of inadequacy.",
