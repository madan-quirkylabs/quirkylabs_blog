    ],
    "neurobiological_mechanisms_summary": "Loneliness in ADHD is underpinned by dysregulation in key brain networks: Frontostriatal circuits (impacting executive functions like attention, impulse control, working memory, which are crucial for smooth social interaction); fronto-limbic pathways (especially amygdala-prefrontal cortex connections, leading to emotional dysregulation and heightened sensitivity to social cues/rejection); and potentially altered reward pathways (contributing to difficulties in sustaining effort for social engagement and seeking immediate gratification over long-term social bonding).",
    "clinical_implications_summary": "Practitioners must adopt a holistic approach, recognizing that loneliness in ADHD is not merely a social deficit but a complex interplay of neurobiological, emotional, and behavioral factors. Interventions should combine pharmacological management of core ADHD symptoms with targeted psychosocial therapies (CBT, DBT, social skills training) to address emotional dysregulation, cognitive distortions, and improve social competence. Fostering self-compassion and connecting individuals with supportive communities are also crucial.",
    "self_report_measures_summary": "Validated self-report measures like the ASRS and CAARS can identify ADHD symptoms, while scales like DERS and RSQ are critical for assessing emotional dysregulation and rejection sensitivity, which are direct drivers of loneliness. LSAS can quantify social anxiety, and ULS directly measures loneliness, providing a comprehensive clinical picture for tailored interventions.",
