This means the body's intrinsic sleep-wake cycle is shifted to a later time, leading to a postponed onset of melatonin production. When forced to wake up before their natural biological clock is ready (due to societal schedules), the brain experiences intense physiological resistance to arousal. Chronic sleep debt accumulates, impairing the prefrontal cortex's ability to regulate mood and arousal upon waking, leading to heightened irritability, fatigue, and an overwhelming feeling of physical/mental discomfort. This misalignment with external schedules creates 'social jet lag' which further exacerbates the morning struggle.",
