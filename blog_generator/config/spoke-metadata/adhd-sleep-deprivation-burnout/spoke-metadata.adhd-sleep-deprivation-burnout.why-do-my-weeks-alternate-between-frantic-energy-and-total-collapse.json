In response, individuals resort to unhelpful coping mechanisms (e.g., overworking, neglecting self-care). Eventually, this culminates in the 'Bust' phase, a state of profound mental and physical depletion where the brain's cognitive resources (especially in the prefrontal cortex) are chronically depleted from sustained effort and compensatory strategies.
