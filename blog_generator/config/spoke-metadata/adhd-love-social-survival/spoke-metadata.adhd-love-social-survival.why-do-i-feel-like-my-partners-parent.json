        "answer": "The 'parent-child dynamic' often arises when the ADHD partner struggles with executive functions like organization, planning, and follow-through, leading the neurotypical partner to unintentionally take on a 'parental' role by managing tasks and reminding. This can cause resentment and erode intimacy. It's a common pattern stemming from neurobiological differences, not a lack of effort or love. *Our Neuro-AI helps you identify specific patterns and rebalance roles for true partnership.*",

That resentment is a valid response to an imbalance, not a judgment of your partner's character. Their brain just needs a different operating system for shared responsibilities. We're here to install the right updates to transform this 'parent-child dynamic' into a thriving, equitable partnership, *activated by your own brain*. Resentment is a symptom of mismatched systems—and we're here to help you build a new one!'"
