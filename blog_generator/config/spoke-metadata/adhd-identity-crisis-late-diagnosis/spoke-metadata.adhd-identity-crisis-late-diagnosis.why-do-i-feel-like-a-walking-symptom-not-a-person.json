Your brain is a different OS, and ADHD is a part of its unique, powerful code. This feeling of being 'just symptoms' is a trauma response from misunderstanding. We're here to install the right updates, helping you rewrite your self-narrative from shame to superpower. You are more than your diagnosis; you are a whole, capable, and vibrant human waiting to flourish!'"
